				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As our Season #2 finale, If Wet #20 was never going to run totally smoothly. Last year&#8217;s finale event was <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/fundraiser-start-delayed-until-530pm/" target="_blank">delayed by a bouncy castle</a>, so we had form. For this event, our main presenting artist, <a href="http://rosannerobertson.com/" target="_blank">Rosanne Robertson</a>, was severely delayed so we had to busk it somewhat. </p>
<p>Luckily, we had invited all of the artists from our second season to come along as our guests and some of them turned up with stuff to present. We also had a couple of great Run What Ya Brung presentations so we were kept very busy until Rosanne arrived.</p>
<p>After Rosanne&#8217;s wonderful presentation/performance we had a section where we read out or played back responses to If Wet from all the artists who presented in 2014. This was lovely, so we have documented that below too.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone for your support this year. We have some [Kickstarter] <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/if-wet-the-future/" target="_blank">plans for next season</a> and we are running a <a href="http://radio.ifwet.org.uk/" target="_blank">radio show</a> (starting on 28th December, 2-4pm) in the meantime. It has been a really lovely year for us.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for coming down to the hall! X</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned we asked all Season #2 artists to attend or send us a response of some kind regarding their experience of If Wet. Here they are:</p>
<p><strong>FLATPACK</strong><br />
<strong><em>Sebastian Hegarty</em></strong><br />
I had a great day with If Wet at the Flatpack Festival, Birmingham. Got to hear the water instrument and the wet acoustics of Trevor Cox with his wave organs, dripping stalactites and subterranean oil reservoir: Lovely people, fascinating ideas and spoiled ears. Thank you very much Sam and David.</p>
<p>Distant Voices: Still Raining is a short damp apology for not being there (If Wet #20). The sound includes the remains of rainfall as it drip-drops through guttering and a short soliloquy in a fragment of voice taken from a telephone conversation with my lovely mam. The piece concludes with the song, I Get the Blues, filched from Terence Davies wonderful film, Distant Voices/Still Lives.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong><em>Trevor Cox</em></strong><br />
I can think of nothing more appropriate for If Wet then to send a sound effect for everyone to enjoy. </p>
<p>It is from a trip to an Oslo train station. This is me chatting in the space so people can hear the effect and it describes what is going on:<br />
<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-1575-2" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://www.sound101.org/blog/describing_the_acoustic_sculpture_in_the_entrance_to_the_national_theatre_station_oslo.mp3?_=2" /><a href="http://www.sound101.org/blog/describing_the_acoustic_sculpture_in_the_entrance_to_the_national_theatre_station_oslo.mp3">http://www.sound101.org/blog/describing_the_acoustic_sculpture_in_the_entrance_to_the_national_theatre_station_oslo.mp3</a></audio></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
And here is a balloon burst, that brings out the warble:<br />
<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-1575-3" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://www.sound101.org/blog/balloon_burst_in_sound%20sculpture_oslo_national_theatre_train_station.mp3?_=3" /><a href="http://www.sound101.org/blog/balloon_burst_in_sound%20sculpture_oslo_national_theatre_train_station.mp3">http://www.sound101.org/blog/balloon_burst_in_sound%20sculpture_oslo_national_theatre_train_station.mp3</a></audio></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The secret behind the warble is that this is space made from two half-cylinders of different radius connected together. </p>
<p><strong>SUPERSONIC</strong><br />
<strong><em>Ryan Jordan</em></strong><br />
Enclosed his press release: “these practitioners practice dark hypnosis in psychoactive hyperventilation clubs”</p>
<p><strong><em>Sarah Kenchington</em></strong><br />
sorry not to reply sooner , I have been a bit gobbled up by my new job working in a chocolate factory.<br />
If wet was great super friendly and interesting. Sorry I won’t be able to make it to Callow End, sounds spooky.<br />
A few weeks before if wet I had been to a car boot sale, and found a rather amazing pedal powered fret saw, I did my usual thing, instead of rehearsing I built a new instrument, I converted the fret saw into a machine to bow my violin. The first gig we did in front of maniac children it didn’t work and then at the If Wet gig it worked like a dream and I pretended I was a virtuoso violin player. Everyone believed me. I also included a bath tub for the first time in my orchestra. Since then I have been using the bath full of water. Getting right into watery trumpet sounds Perhaps you could play  the  thing I did on the Isle of Eigg. I thought it would be appropriate for an If Wet event .Wet as anything it is.<br />

<p><strong><em>Graham Dunning</em></strong><br />
In the spirit of If Wet me and Leslie decided to make an instrument and make some sounds with it. I had a wooden box with a lid knocking about and we bought some other bits and bobs from the local 98p Store. We recorded the whole process of making and experimenting as we went, with a nod to Robert Morris&#8217; Box With The Sound of Its Own Making &#8211; the intention was to edit that down to a short piece for you to play. </p>

“It was great fun and fascinating to meet other makers and sonic explorers at ‘If Wet’. An opportunity to meet other likeminded individuals, and a relief to realise there are people out there with similar interests. You are not alone! A chance to share ideas and take contraptions out of the workshop, even if they are still works in progress. Thanks guys, have fun, sorry not to join you there!”</p>

<p><strong><em>And a separate message from KEK</em></strong><br />
&#8220;Hey. Thanks for the 2014 village-hall invite, IF-WETTERS; really enjoyed scrrra-a-a-a-aping the HTML from your website and turning it into MIDI-file music. Never played a musical web-page before. Digging those Tuh-tuh-text squirts, man; it&#8217;s the New Serialism&#8221;</p>

<p><strong><em>Lee Patterson (1st)</em></strong><br />
As always, I&#8217;m on the last minute, in fact it&#8217;s a wonder I made it to either of the If Wet events that I contributed to this year &#8211; Bardsea and Callow End&#8230; Anyhow, both events reminded me that, despite the isolated way in which we may consume and produce music, music always has a social element &#8211; whether implied or actual and opportunities to share with like minds are increasingly rare. So, Sam, David &#8211; keep up the good work at Callow End and elsewhere!<br />
Right, got to rush to catch a train to Huddersfield!</p>

<strong><em>Pete Ashton</em></strong><br />
<em>Present</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Ben Gwilliam</em></strong><br />
If wet? not as much as it would be where I live, callow end hall dry n all.<br />
Thanks very much for the opportunity to try out elements of current works, that although they are incomplete, at if wet I can test the metal of the idea and importantly the way it sounds.<br />
As much as I try out sound as music, you gave me an opportunity to test visual work that confirms for me the direction that making stuff like this does: always in the opposite of what everything else is!</p>
<p>So I wish you all the best for this last one of the season, I do hope that season three makes it round swiftly next year. Every town should have a collective space for discussion, presentation &#038; banter on artists work that is as informal &#038; invaluable as if wet. Doing these activities keep the arts real. So continue to keep it real.</p>
<p>THANK YOU ALL!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-onwards_thankyou2.jpg" alt="Thank You" width="615" height="236" /></p>
<p>We did it! From what started as a bit of experiment, we seemed to build some momentum over our first season, topped off by our Season Finale and Fundraiser event at the end of November 2013. It was a stressful event, due in part to <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/fundraiser-start-delayed-until-530pm/" target="_blank">this</a>, but it also felt like a triumphant celebration of all we had achieved in our first season. Many fond memories, and we even raised some money.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everyone who made our first season and fundraiser a success. People were generous beyond our wildest expectations. Below is a picture of Sarah Angliss playing at our fundraiser. Sarah has supported throughout but our thanks extend to so many people that we aren&#8217;t even going to attempt a list. Hopefully you know who you are, we certainly do.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sa.jpg" alt="Sarah Angliss" width="615" height="407" /></p>
<p>Our fundraising efforts raised just over £1200. Not bad for a sound art event in a rural village hall. Read on to find out what 2014 holds.</p>
<h1>Onward</h1>
<p>In order to make this sustainable, we have set a budget of £400 for each If Wet. Therefore the funds we have raised so far will cover three events in the village hall in 2014. We are now looking for funding for additional events in this our home venue. We hope that potential funders will see the effort and outcomes of our first season and will be willing to match our own fundraising. We&#8217;ll see. We&#8217;d certainly love to do more events in our hall this year, since this is where the heart of If Wet lies.</p>
<p>Once we see how we get on with our search for funding, we will define our programme at Callow End Village Hall, but for now we just wanted to provide this update and statement of intent.</p>
<p>Also, If Wet has grown wings and will take flight in 2014, stopping to perch at a variety of venues &#8211; occasionally with a subtly different format. First up, we have been asked by <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/" target="_blank">Flatpack Festival</a> to host an If Wet as part of their festival this year. The second If Wet outing of the year will be the Southbank Centre, when we host a <a href="http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/meet-the-makers-80800" target="_blank">Meet The Makers</a> event. Then we are talking with <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/" target="_blank">Capsule</a> about a potentially very exciting event in April. More details on all of these soon but we are delighted to be keeping such fabulous company!</p>
<p>AND we secured funding through <a href="http://www.soundandmusic.org/" target="_blank">Sound and Music</a>, which will see us tour some village halls this year.</p>
<p>Wowee! Thanks again to all who have supported us.</p>
<p>ONWARD.</p>

Here is the full audio recording, in two parts: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-7-part-1" target="_blank"><strong>Part1</strong></a> / <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-7-part-2" target="_blank"><strong>Part2</strong></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of what went on, so you can access topics of interest:</p>

<p>[1:30 &#8211; 22:05 | Part 1]</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The main reason that it&#8217;s in a trolley is that if you move this trolley around, as you move over differently reflective areas it changes pitch.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Getting the backing off the tape proved to be the most challenging thing because Sam has got no fingernails and I&#8217;ve got bad eyesight.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;What we have done is take the optical reader for the synth and put it under the trolley, and then any design on the floor sequences the sound as you move it across it.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/10872260325/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5535/10872260325_a9c5d855c7_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 7 - October - 03" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;David insisted on this humiliation for me on a regular basis.&#8221;</em><br />
[Sam talking about completing a touch circuit using Sam&#8217;s head &#8211; pictured above]</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The reaction from the public was &#8216;this is really fascinating&#8217;. [&#8230;] Now I wouldn&#8217;t have expected that reaction but it was a solid repeated reaction. They don&#8217;t know what contact mics sound like.&#8221;</em><br />
[David talking about the addition of a contact mic to the underside of the trolley top]</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Ian Rawes</h1>
<p>[20:05 &#8211; 1:03:00 | Part 1]<br />
First we welcomed Ian Rawes of the British Library Sound Archive and <a href="http://www.soundsurvey.org.uk/" target="_blank">London Sound Survey</a> to present a series of fascinating archival recordings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/10872573183/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3794/10872573183_0550e6a70b_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 7 - October - 05" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;They are called transcriptions discs. They are old 78 RPM discs and they&#8217;ve got programmes and out-takes, and some things which were never broadcast at all. [&#8230;] The BBC don&#8217;t actually know about a lot of these things, or they&#8217;ve forgotten about them. When I first came across them I was very excited because you hear another world of sound.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I am interested in the sounds of everyday life, not really the great and the good being interviewed, which is what the vast majority of the old recordings are.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The earliest microphones or recording equipment was very insensitive to sound. [&#8230;] They are always shouting; you get the impression people were very angry or very emphatic.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/10872388034/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3676/10872388034_1be61df018_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 7 - October - 08" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The very oldest, surviving public recording in Britain [&#8230;] is from Crystal Palace in 1888. [&#8230;] Handel&#8217;s Messiah performed by a 4000-strong choir. [&#8230;] It has a certain quality as you will hear.&#8221;</em><br />
[Ian describing the remarkable recording which begins at 01:00:30]</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Helen White</h1>
<p>[00:10 &#8211; 30:05 | Part 2]<br />
Our final presentation of 2013, was by <a href="http://www.helenwhitedesign.com/" target="_blank">Helen White</a> who brought along her wonderful solar-wind chime to show us.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/10872243685/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5530/10872243685_fef542c670_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 7 - October - 09" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a solar-wind chime that gathers data from the sun. It&#8217;s not everyday that you look at data from satellites and turn it into magnetic resonance, so I will try to explain how we got there.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The sun is ninety-three million miles away and it&#8217;s spewing charred particles at us all the time. [&#8230;] These particles have different effects depending on all sorts of properties in them.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The three characters of the solar wind are: its speed, its density and the magnetic direction that the particles are facing. [&#8230;] That&#8217;s what this piece of work focusses on; it reads the speed of the wind and interprets it through a series of sounds.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The data comes from a satellite called ACE.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/10872370774/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3756/10872370774_ab79fc2241_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 7 - October - 13" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I love the idea that it can be so gentle and subtle. In fact, I had this on my desk, it was playing and I switched off from it. It was kind of like that ticking clock, it just disappears.&#8221;</em></p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Run What Ya Brung</h1>
<p>We run a regular feature at If Wet in which members of the audience are invited to bring along and demonstrate instruments, sound objects and sonic oddities. For the first time nobody presented anything in this section, in part due to our regular contributors being away. A shame but this did result in is another first; we finished on time!</p>

<p>We are having to delay the start of our <a href="fundraiser.ifwet.org.uk" target="_blank">fundraiser</a> by 30 minutes, due to a double-booking made by the people who organise the village hall. As a result we will only be able to get into the hall at 5pm and we are told they will still be removing a bouncy castle at the time! This might make things a little more shambolic/charming in general as we wont have the time we&#8217;d hoped to set up and test &#8211; but we&#8217;ll manage. If you do arrive at 5pm you will of course be welcomed in but please consider delaying until 5:30pm if you can.</p>
<p>Once in, grab yourself a drink, make yourself comfortable and we will start around 6pm with a presentation by your hosts MortonUnderwood.</p>
<p>Apologies for any inconvenience caused. See you soon!</p>
<p><em>The whole bouncy castle inside a village hall thing had passed us by but the image above is in fact of Callow End Village Hall.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our final If Wet of the season is fast approaching; <strong>SATURDAY 30th November, 5.30pm &#8211; 11pm</strong>. <em>Note: <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/fundraiser-start-delayed-until-530pm/" target="_blank">slight delay</a> in starting due to a bouncy castle.</em></p>
<p>For our final event we have a much extended offering, on a Saturday, so people can join us in celebrating our first season. By coming to this special fundraising event you will be helping to make our second season happen.</p>
<p>There will be presentations and discussion, much like a normal If Wet, but this event will feature musical performances more centrally.</p>
<p>JOIN US for a night of sonic exploration and wonderment >> <a href="https://ifwet-fundraiser.eventbrite.co.uk" target="_blank">Tickets here</a> </p>
<p><strong>Line-up:</strong><br />
Sarah Angliss / Isle of Everywhere / ORE / Nimzo-Indian / Soundhog (DJ) / MortonUnderwood</p>
<h1>MortonUnderwood</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/david.jpg" alt="Morton" width="615" height="308" /></p>

<div class="imageTitle">Underwood</div>
<p>Your every faithful hosts, <a href="http://mortonunderwood.co.uk" title="MortonUnderwood" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will welcome you to the final If Wet of the season with a smile &#8211; all being well. The evening will start with some time for guests (new and old) to mingle and settle into the space and pace of the village hall &#8211; and explore the various goodies in the fundraising auction etc. We will then present a celebratory review of the previous events before moving on to showcase stuff that will feature in the fundraising auction. Then, the latest presentation of work by MortonUnderwood.</p>
<h1>Nimzo-Indian</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mini-guitar.jpg" alt="Nimzo-Indian" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Nimzo-Indian</div>
<p>Next up there will be a presentation and live performance by Nimzo-Indian, an alter-ego of artist and technologist <a href="http://fatsuma.co.uk/pages/frame2.html" target="_blank">Fatsuma</a>. Andy will discuss his work and present four mini guitars he has built, before going on to deliver an unpredictable performance with them.</p>
<p><em>At this point we&#8217;ll break for some refreshments. Hot food and drinks will be provided, as will cakes, snacks, wine, local ale and soft drinks.</em></p>
<h1>ORE</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ore.jpg" alt="ORE" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">ORE</div>
<p>With your belly full of grub, ease into a satiated transcendental state with a live set from drone doom tuba duo <a href="http://www.oretubadoom.com" target="_blank">ORE</a>. Again there will be a brief discussion about their ethos and working method ahead of the performance.</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F107308486&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938"></iframe></p>
<h1>Isle of Everywhere</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ioe.jpg" alt="Isle of Everywhere" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Isle of Everywhere</div>
<p>After ORE we are delighted to welcome back a band that were at our inaugural If Wet in April, the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/IsleOfE" target="_blank">Isle of Everywhere</a> (duo). They feature Stuart on tuba (if he has any puff left after playing with ORE) and Simon on santur. A rare combination; together in dub. <em>Note: this is a duo performance without Lydia on drums.</em></p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/66818452" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" title="Hammered Tubstep" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h1>Sarah Angliss</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sarah1.jpg" alt="Sarah Angliss" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Sarah Angliss</div>
<p>Our last live act of the evening is <a href="http://www.sarahangliss.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Angliss</a>. Her last appearance at If Wet was a delight to behold and we are very pleased to welcome her back; only this time the emphasis will be much more on performance rather than discussion of working methods &#8211; although there will be a element of that too!</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F104099953&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938&#038;in=spacedoguk%2Fsets%2Fsarah-angliss-music-samples-1"></iframe></p>
<h1>Soundhog</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soundhog.jpg" alt="Soundhog" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Soundhog</div>
<p>The rest of the evening will be spent celebrating and discussing, to a soundtrack provided by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundhog" target="_blank">Soundhog</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F39920118&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938"></iframe></p>
<p>We are not really sure what more we can do to entice you to our village hall; it should be a really distinctive experience. Step out of your world and into ours for a night. </p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall on Saturday the 30th November at 5pm! Tickets on the door, £14. Or we have a few other ticket options available <a href="https://ifwet-fundraiser.eventbrite.co.uk" target="_blank">on-line</a> </p>
