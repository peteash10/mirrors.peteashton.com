				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have never published an If Wet preview so close to an event before but we wanted to tell you because we are delighted with the extended line-up and events we have put together for <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com/" target="_blank">Supersonic Festival</a> &#8211; taking place tomorrow, 31st May 2014. JOIN US. The day will go something like this:</p>
<p>We will kick things off as usual, demonstrating our latest piece of work, <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com/line-up/exhibitions/descent-morton-underwood" target="_blank">Descent</a>, which you can actually go and use during the time of the festival.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sarah.jpg" alt="Sarah Kenchington" width="614" height="699" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Sarah Kenchington</div>
<p>The first visiting artist to present is Sarah Kenchington. Sarah is a musical instrument builder. She makes wondrous acoustic machines, which she amalgamates into one large instrument that she does solo performances with. It is a sight and sound to behold.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/42044785" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" title="On Another Note" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Sarah will present her work and musical instruments in the salon part of our event, which starts at 5.30pm. She will then delight us with a performance (also in the Theatre Space) from around 8:45pm.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ryan.jpg" alt="ryan" width="614" height="391" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Ryan Jordan</div>
<p>Next up we have Ryan Jordan, who is a noise artist working with derelict electronics. He is also an instrument maker but Ryan&#8217;s work is predominantly electronic; building crude instruments that replicate fundamental electronic components. His sound is very far removed from that created by Sarah but this is what If Wet is all about. We hope you will find parallels in their work that go beyond the end product.</p>

<p>Ryan will present his work and creations in the salon part of our event, which starts at 5.30pm. He will then perform his liveset on the Second Stage at 8:45pm.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rwyb.jpg" alt="Richard Windley" width="614" height="410" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Richard Windley &#8211; doing a RWYB</div>
<p>From 7.30pm we have the most full-on Run What Ya Brung section ever at an If Wet, with a number of artists presenting work and sonic curiosities. This is co-organised by <a href="http://stryx.co.uk/" target="_blank">Stryx</a>.</p>
<p>We have always been lucky enough to have wonderful work presented in our Run What Ya Brung section. You can expect lots to relish and ponder from this one!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/graham.jpg" alt="graham" width="614" height="410" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Graham Dunning</div>
<p>Lastly, we are delighted to welcome Graham Dunning back to If Wet. Graham will perform a set for us using his latest set-up; a sort of mechanical techno thing. This will take place in the Theatre Space from 9.45pm.</p>
<p>I have no doubt we can convince Graham to explain it more on the night but here is a video to whet your appetite.</p>

<p>We hope to see many friendly, and lots of new, faces tomorrow. JOIN US.</p>
