<p>We are having to delay the start of our <a href="fundraiser.ifwet.org.uk" target="_blank">fundraiser</a> by 30 minutes, due to a double-booking made by the people who organise the village hall. As a result we will only be able to get into the hall at 5pm and we are told they will still be removing a bouncy castle at the time! This might make things a little more shambolic/charming in general as we wont have the time we&#8217;d hoped to set up and test &#8211; but we&#8217;ll manage. If you do arrive at 5pm you will of course be welcomed in but please consider delaying until 5:30pm if you can.</p>
<p>Once in, grab yourself a drink, make yourself comfortable and we will start around 6pm with a presentation by your hosts MortonUnderwood.</p>
<p>Apologies for any inconvenience caused. See you soon!</p>
<p><em>The whole bouncy castle inside a village hall thing had passed us by but the image above is in fact of Callow End Village Hall.</em></p>
