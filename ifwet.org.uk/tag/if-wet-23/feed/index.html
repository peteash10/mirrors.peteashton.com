				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our third If Wet of the season saw us hosting a special event as part of <a href="http://www.3choirs.org/" target="_blank">Three Choirs Festival</a>. The turnout was heart-warming with the venue having to be changed twice due to over subscription.</p>
<p>This event focussed on the Theremin and we were delighted to have leading player and aficionado Lydia Kavina as our guest. We explored the sound of the Theremin and how other sounds / synths are sometimes mistaken for one. We then looked at similarities between the timbre of the Theremin and the human voice; culminating in a duet between Lydia and singer Emily Prosser &#8211; <em>pictured below</em>.</p>
<p>We will leave any further description of the event to The Jazz Mann, who provided this <a href="http://www.thejazzmann.com/features/article/music-and-...-the-theremin/" target="_blank">in-depth review</a>; for which we are very grateful. </p>

<p><strong>Thank you to Lydia, Emily and Three Choirs for helping us put this event on.</strong> And to all those who attended! We had a great time.</p>
