				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As outlined in <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/if-wet-the-future/" target="_blank">our future plans</a>, we are starting a regular monthly radio programme, to fall &#8211; as If Wet does &#8211; on the last Sunday of the month, from 2-4pm; during our off-season.</p>
<p>At present we are thinking we will &#8220;broadcast&#8221; via Mixcloud (embedded on our site) and we are also finalising plans with <a href="http://www.soundartradio.org.uk/" title="Soundart Radio" target="_blank">Soundart Radio</a> to include our show in their schedule.</p>
<p>For now, the shows will be pre-recorded but we plan to always make them live in a given timeslot and then be on-hand via <a href="https://twitter.com/If_Wet" target="_blank">Twitter </a> for any interaction and feedback. Our first show will provide some holiday listening for most, as it will be aired at 2pm on December the 28th.</p>
<p>Each show will focus on a different musical instrument and is intended to drive our research and development as instrument makers, as well as hopefully being entertaining! It&#8217;s not intended to be comprehensive; more a snapshot of what we have unearthed to date.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 120%;">Please help!</strong><br />
We need your help, on two fronts:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have never run a radio show before so please let us know anything you know about that. Anything goes at this stage; from suggestions that our approach is all wrong, through to personal reflections about what you like as a listener</li>
<li>Links and suggestions for our first show, which will focus on the <strong>tuba</strong>. Please just add information on anything or anyone you think is exciting in the world of the tuba, via the comments. We are open to all sorts: from contacting players for input, to talking about technical aspects, to playing banging brass band party tunes. We&#8217;d rather you popped it in the comments and we didn&#8217;t end up featuring it than missing something great that&#8217;s out there&#8230;</li>
</ol>
<p>SO, please help us by popping your comments below. We look forward to reading them!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 80%;">[Oh and we have some ideas for what instruments to feature next but we welcome yours]</span></p>
