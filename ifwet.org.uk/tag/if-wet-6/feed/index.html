				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long until If Wet #7; <strong>Sunday 27th October, 2-4pm</strong>. For our penultimate event of our first season we have a double-bill made up of the fabulous <a href="http://www.helenwhitedesign.com/" target="_blank">Helen White</a> and <a href="http://www.soundsurvey.org.uk/" target="_blank">Ian Rawes</a>. JOIN US.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/hw-s.jpg" alt="Helen White" width="694" height="392" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Solar-wind Chime, Helen White</div>
<p>Inspired by recent media attention on solar flares and their effects on both positive and predicted negative events (the northern lights / technological disruption), Helen has been exploring creative ways to respond to this natural phenomena. She will be presenting her &#8216;solar-wind&#8217; chime, a slowly-evolving resonating sculpture that responds in real-time to solar wind data collected from a satellite an hour away from earth, and she&#8217;ll be talking about working with complicated scientific principles and aesthetically bereft data sources that finally led her to listen to the sun.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/65346809" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>By day Ian Rawes works in the sound archive at the British Library. He also runs <a href="http://www.soundsurvey.org.uk/" target="_blank">London Sound Survey</a>, a growing collection of Creative Commons-licensed sound recordings of places, events and wildlife in the capital.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lss.gif" alt="London Sound Survey" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">London Sound Survey, Ian Rawes</div>
<p>Ian will present a series of rarely-heard and never-heard archival recordings of vanished customs and daily life from London in the 1920s to the 1950s. Performing dogs, fortune tellers, Mike Stern the mayor of Petticoat Lane, lavender sellers, the singing sewer workers of the New Kent Road, Commander Daniel&#8217;s noise nuisances, Godfrey the bagpipe king and how London Zoo&#8217;s animals helped win the war.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mu.jpg" alt="Sound Trolley" width="615" height="443" /></p>
<p>Your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will be presenting the Sound Trolley they built for their recent artist residency at the Library of Birmingham.</p>
<p>We will also have our regular Run What Ya Brung section where anyone can do a brief, informal presentation of a sonic curiosity they might own or have built. Last month we had Richard Windley with and acoustic guitar (!) and harp combo he had made. Please JOIN US and contribute!</p>
<p>We will also have the usual yummy treats of home-made food, cakes and a local ale.</p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall on Sunday the 27th October at 2pm! Tickets on the door.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long now until our sixth If Wet; <strong>Sunday 29th September, 2-4pm</strong>. We have a double-bill for you made up of the fabulous <a href="http://grahamdunning.com/" target="_blank">Graham Dunning</a> and <a href="http://soundhog.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Soundhog</a>. JOIN US.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dunning.jpg" alt="Music by the metre" width="615" height="345" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Music by the Metre, Graham Dunning</div>
<p>Graham will be presenting his <em>Music by the Metre</em> project, including a live build of a <em>Music by the Metre</em> piece. The project is an homage to situationist Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio who made and sold abstract &#8220;painting by the metre&#8221;.</p>
<p>Each one is a system of sound making machines which will play indefinitely if left to run. The resulting audio is never changing but never the same: loops of different tempos mix with unstable drones and live environmental sound (a mic out of the window) to make a stable but evolving collage. For If Wet Graham will build one of these conglomerate machines and talk through this process.</p>
<p>Graham is also making a run of 10 recycled tapes individually recorded with a different <em>Music by the Metre</em> piece on each side and a handmade cover.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/soundhog.jpg" alt="Soundhog" width="615" height="345" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Soundhog</div>
<p>Soundhog (Ben) is a bit of an unknown quantity in the context of If Wet. In fact, we don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;ll be covering yet. It&#8217;s quite likely Ben doesn&#8217;t know yet either. BUT we do know that he has a wealth of knowledge, a rich history of making Bastard Pop hits, a fascination for antiquated recordings and technologies, and a near encyclopaedic knowledge of pop music. Soundhog doesn&#8217;t come out to play often so miss this at your peril.</p>
<p>Oh, and he only has a Wikipedia page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundhog" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundhog</a></p>

<p>All being well, your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will be presenting a few projects they have been working on lately, as part of Sam&#8217;s artist residency at <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/" target="_blank">THSH Birmingham</a>.</p>
<p>We will also have our regular Run What Ya Brung section where anyone can do a brief, informal presentation of a sonic curiosity they might own or have built. Last month we had a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-5-snippet" target="_blank">delightful performance</a> of viola da gamba and recorder music, a phone based drone synthesis tool and a self-made, bass drone string instrument. Please JOIN US and contribute!</p>
<p>We will also have the usual yummy treats of home-made food, cakes and a local ale.</p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall on Sunday the 29th September at 2pm!</p>
<p><a href="http://ifwet6.eventbrite.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tickets can be purchased here</a>.</p>
