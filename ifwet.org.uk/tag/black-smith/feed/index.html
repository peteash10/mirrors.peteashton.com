				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking we have resolved not to document remote If Wets. There is a lot involved in putting them on and in our local hall we know better what we face. This means the If Wets at <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/if-wet-at-flatpack-preview/" target="_blank">Flatpack Festival</a> and the <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/if-wet-at-southbank-preview/" target="_blank">Southbank Centre</a> are documented only in preview form and in the memories of their attendees.</p>
<p>If Wet at Supersonic is a little different, though, because Sam normally contributes a rambling blog post to the <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com/news/supersonic-festival-2014-collective-memory/2014/" target ="_blank">Supersonic Collective Memory</a>, so we felt we ought to provide a few photos (taken by David during the event) at least.</p>
<p>We spoke about our project <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com/news/descent-morton-underwood/2014/" target="_blank">Descent</a> first. If you are very quick you may still catch it at Millenium Point.</p>
<p>Then we had <a href="https://vimeo.com/42044785" target="_blank">Sarah Kenchington</a> talk, followed by <a href="http://nnnnn.org.uk/doku.php" target="_blank">Ryan Jordan</a>. This led on to an extended Run What Ya Brung section, co-run by <a href="http://stryx.co.uk/" target="_blank">Stryx</a>, with presentations by various artists. The day finished with wonderful performances by Sarah Kenchington and <a href="http://grahamdunning.com/" target="_blank">Graham Dunning</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures and a few lines about what went on.</p>

<p>We have rooted around for some reviews but most reviewers seem to have stuck to the main stages. Here are a couple of exceptions &#8211; <a href="http://echoesanddust.com/2014/06/o-festival-review-supersonic-custard-factory-birmingham-30th-31st-may-2014/" target="_blank">1</a> / <a href="http://thequietus.com/articles/15478-supersonic-festival-2014-review" target="_blank">2</a>.</p>
<p>We enjoyed what the former said of Sarah Kenchington, <em>&#8220;It really felt like she summed up everything Supersonic was actually about &#8211; pushing the limits of what music is and how we should think about it.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It was a delight to behold. Thank you to everyone who presented and performed, and to all of you who came to witness it.</p>
<p>Next up, we are off on tour to four village halls across the country. We are delighted with the line-up. <strong>Have a look and buy tickets <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/if-wet-2014-tour-preview/" target="_blank">HERE</a></strong>. JOIN US.</p>
