				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our second If Wet of the season saw us hosting a special event in our home village hall. In fact, for various reasons, it is the only event we have planned to take place in our village hall this year.</p>
<p>Late last year, John Doran of <a href="http://thequietus.com/" target="_blank">The Quietus</a> got in touch to ask about us hosting him for an event as part of his tour, to launch his new book <em>Jolly Lad</em>. We weren&#8217;t entirely sure how this fitted with a standard If Wet but we thought we&#8217;d go for it; in part to just keep bringing exciting stuff to Callow End.</p>
<p>As John intended to perform readings from his book, accompanied by music from <a href="http://www.arabrot.com/imodi/" target="_blank">Arabrot</a>, we decided the emphasis would be more on performance than usual at an If Wet. We also decided to try and find a selection of artists for whom storytelling was central to their work. The wonderful <a href="http://www.sarahangliss.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Angliss</a> immediately sprang to mind but we wanted to have two further artists to accompany John and Arabrot. David and I chatted and he reminded me of <a href="http://www.josephinedickinson.com/" target="_blank">Josephine Dickinson</a>, who we had met when running If Wet at <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/documentation/if-wet-2014-tour-weekend-2/" target="_blank">Bardsea Malt Kiln</a> last year. I got in touch with her, and her enthusiasm to be involved was palpable&#8230;so that was our line-up sorted!</p>
<p>Tickets sold well and we were delighted to have a great turnout on the day as well; The hall was as full as it has ever been for an If Wet. We started by setting the scene and briefly demonstrating the headset for our latest project <em>Amplification</em>, before handing over to Josephine for her delightful talk, which covered studying under the tutelage of Michael Finnissy and going mushroom picking with John Cage.</p>
