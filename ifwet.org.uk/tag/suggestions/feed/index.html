<h1>Friends!</h1>
<p>We will soon enter our second season of If Wet events. The details of this are still very much to be defined but here is our <a href=http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/if-wet-2014/ target="_blank">statement of intent</a>. As you can see we could be doing quite a few events, including a number away from home.</p>
<p>We have some people in mind that we would like to invite to present (Sarah Kenchington and Paul Granjon are high on Sam&#8217;s list) but we&#8217;d love to hear your suggestions too. So, if you know someone who you think does interesting sonic work and could present it for around one hour in a relaxed village hall setting, please pop names, links and details in the comments field below. We welcome your suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
