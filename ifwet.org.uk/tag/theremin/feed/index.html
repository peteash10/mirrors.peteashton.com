				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our third If Wet of the season saw us hosting a special event as part of <a href="http://www.3choirs.org/" target="_blank">Three Choirs Festival</a>. The turnout was heart-warming with the venue having to be changed twice due to over subscription.</p>
<p>This event focussed on the Theremin and we were delighted to have leading player and aficionado Lydia Kavina as our guest. We explored the sound of the Theremin and how other sounds / synths are sometimes mistaken for one. We then looked at similarities between the timbre of the Theremin and the human voice; culminating in a duet between Lydia and singer Emily Prosser &#8211; <em>pictured below</em>.</p>
<p>We will leave any further description of the event to The Jazz Mann, who provided this <a href="http://www.thejazzmann.com/features/article/music-and-...-the-theremin/" target="_blank">in-depth review</a>; for which we are very grateful. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our third event was something of a triumph; it was lively and well attended, and as ever our guests did us proud!</p>
<p>Here is the full audio recording, in two parts: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-3-part-1" target="_blank"><strong>Part1</strong></a> / <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-3-part-2" target="_blank"><strong>Part2</strong></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of what went on, so you can access topics of interest:</p>
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9179152226/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3831/9179152226_7284fc0c80_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 3 - June - 41" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 520px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I am aware that some of you know this, as some of you have been to every single If Wet.&#8221;</em></p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">MortonUnderwood present&#8230;</h1>
<p>[2:52 &#8211; 17:20 | Part 1]</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Foghorn Requiem recording</h2>
<p>[6:36 &#8211; 09:31 | Part 1]<br />
We played back a recording of the <a href="http://foghornrequiem.org/" target="_blank">Foghorn Requiem</a> David made when we travelled up to South Shields the weekend before If Wet #3. In many senses, this was the first of what could potentially become a series of If Wet sonic outings&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/foghorn1.jpg" alt="Foghorn Requiem" width="625" height="417" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 500px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Sam Underwood</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;This is the finale. There is a mournful chorale at the end from the brass bands and then it goes to the foghorn part and they discharge the full extent of the air chambers through the foghorn, so you hear how the sound meanders and peters out.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;They explained that normally they wouldn&#8217;t run the foghorn like that but [&#8230;] because it was the last time it was ever going to be sounded properly they ran the cylinders right until everything was completely depleted and run out, which is why it sounds particularly mournful.&#8221;</em></p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">3D mouthpieces</h2>
<p>[9:36 &#8211; 17:20 | Part 1]<br />
Next up, we provided a brief update on our work building 3D mouthpieces. David described and demonstrated a working saxophone mouthpiece.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mouthpieces.jpg" alt="3D mouthpieces" width="625" height="425" /></p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The software has been upgraded now so the rafts are much easier to come off in one piece.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I now need to re-learn some of the fundamentals so I am getting to the stage where I am building models myself.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Sam reflecting on what&#8217;s next in terms of our exploration of 3D printing]</span></p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Paul John presents the clavichord</h1>
<p>[17:25 &#8211; 44:00 | Part 1]<br />
Paul John discusses the history of clavichords, which featured him playing in-the-round.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9179117972/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5521/9179117972_26c56b65c1_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 3 - June - 06" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 520px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s closer to the piano in its expressiveness than it is to the harpsichord.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;In the 18th century it was often used in stacks, in pairs, [&#8230;] so that an organist could practice at home.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9179173918/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7283/9179173918_3711e63a08_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 3 - June - 10" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 520px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It came out of, probably, ancient Greek methods of teaching mathematics, the acoustics of music from a single stretched string between two points and finding that if you put pressure on the string here and there that you get the fundamental and the octave.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9176950973/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3734/9176950973_be7a88ac75_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 3 - June - 08" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 520px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p>The courtesy and attentiveness of an If Wet audience is always high (they have to put up with us blathering on after all) but in this section it was particularly tangible. The volume of the clavichord is such that it rewards close listening. It was a delight to behold how enchanted everyone looked when Paul was playing.</p>
<p>Next up, Sarah Angliss.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Sarah Angliss</h1>
<p>[1:07 &#8211; 52:31 | Part 2]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9176914445/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3778/9176914445_37130489d0_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 3 - June - 19" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;That&#8217;s the act. I genuinely don&#8217;t know quite what it is; it sort of lives somewhere between cabaret and experimental electronics.</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;You actually imbue notes with life by sort of expressing yourself as you play the note. And on the recorder you have a very good parallel with what is going on with the clavichord.</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;There is a roboticist, Rodney Brooks who said &#8220;The real world is its own best model&#8221;. [&#8230;] You might spend a vast amount of money on bell samples but in the end the best bell sample is a bell, situated in a room, vibrating away as only bells can do. [&#8230;] We are actually quite hungry for physical, situated sound. That&#8217;s something I am very, very into.</em></p>
<p>As a keen saw player, Sarah moves on to discuss and demonstrate the saw as a musical instrument. </p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It was like the skiffle instrument of its time. It was what you did if you couldn&#8217;t afford a violin.&#8221;</em><br />

<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 520px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p>The discussion moved on to focus on performance and Sarah&#8217;s thoughts on this.</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Coupling; which is the idea that when I see a performance I want to see what the performer is doing, coupled in some obvious way to what we are hearing. Otherwise I will switch off.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Why are we all here sharing this sound rather than just simply listening to it at home?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;You&#8217;ll notice at the beginning that I tuned up in front of you. I didn&#8217;t actually need to tune up in front of you. I do that before I start a show so that people realise I am controlling the sound, and I am not reacting to the sound.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Sarah talking about helping the audience to appreciate the cause and effect when she plays Theremin]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;People credit him with a lot more intelligence than he actually has. [&#8230;] I am actually using old magician&#8217;s tricks, lots of misdirections.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about her robot, Hugo]</span></p>
<p>Sarah moves on to discuss and demonstrate her phonograph.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9179223896/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5524/9179223896_f66883657d_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 3 - June - 29" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;This is entirely clockwork sound, there is no electronic amplification whatsoever.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Demonstrating a recording.]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It has not escaped out notice that the voices of the dead can be reheard.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Quoting Scientific American response to the phonograph when originally demonstrated.]</span></p>
<p>Members of the If Wet audience were then given the opportunity to make a recording on the phonograph. A short piece was recorded featuring the voices of Tim Cranmore (Worcestershire Poet Laureate), Sarah Angliss and David Morton on saxophone.</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;You would have to remove that stylus and replace it with a heavier one. And then you spoke into the horn, the horn would vibrate the stylus and it was heavy enough to cut the groove in the wax.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[On how to record using a phonograph]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s an artefact of the recording process. How you have to perform and the way it gets filtered. So, it makes you start to realise that this idea of how old voices sound is often the recording process rather than the people.&#8221;</em><br />

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Run What Ya Brung</h1>
<p>[41:32 &#8211; 57:00 | Part 2]<br />
We run a regular feature at If Wet in which members of the audience are invited to bring along and demonstrate instruments, sound objects and sonic oddities. Sometimes we get lots of contributions, sometimes just one (so far never nought). This month was stellar, with fabulous contributions from Caroline Radcliffe, Richard Windley and Tim Cranmore.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 130%;">Caroline Radcliffe</h1>
<p>[54:00 &#8211; 1:03:58 | Part 2 | pre-amble by Sarah Angliss]<br />
Caroline Radcliffe demonstrated some clog dancing and spoke about how many of the moves, from the 18th century, imitated the machinery in the cotton mills.</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I get really fed up with all these techno people claiming that they&#8217;ve only just invented something. What I want to show is that repetitive labour and sound was connected way before Detroit techno and all sorts of other processes.&#8221;</em></p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 130%;">Richard Windley</h1>
<p>[01:05:46 &#8211; 01:10:24 | Part 2]<br />
We can&#8217;t get enough of Richard at If Wet and he was back with a bizarre self-made synth on a multi-layered stand.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.richardwindley.co.uk/" target="_blank">richardwindley.co.uk</a></p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 130%;">Tim Cranmore</h1>
<p>[01:10:50 &#8211; 01:20:54 | Part 2]<br />
Tim is a local recorder maker and maker/player in the UK Vegetable Orchestra. This was his second contribution to If Wet, where he covered three-holed pipes, including two rare bass pipes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9179252828/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/9179252828_02f834a219_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 3 - June - 38" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>

<p>Once again, the event ended with a lot of people sticking around to chat. One of the core aims of If Wet it to build links locally. We are confident there are people who share our interests out there and we&#8217;d like to hook up with them to form some sort of creative community. Another successful If Wet, see you at the next one!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If Wet #2 was a slightly more intimate affair than If Wet #1. The first hot day for ages and a bank holiday Sunday surely didn&#8217;t help in terms of numbers but we had a fun and informative time hosting the wonderful Juneau Projects.</p>
<p>Here is the full audio recording, in two parts: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-2-part-1" target="_blank"><strong>Part1</strong></a> / <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-2-part-2" target="_blank"><strong>Part2</strong></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of what went on, so you can access topics of interest:</p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;If at any point in proceedings you want to interject, ask a question, just stick your hand up. We have a very open forum throughout all of this!&#8221;</em></p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Noise box synths and optical sequencer</h2>
<p>[2:52 &#8211; 34:08 | Part 1]<br />
We brought along three of our Game Conroller noise box synths, a stereo noise box (codenamed THE BEAST), a controller in a Spam tin and our prototype optical sequencer to demo.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/8905065399/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8560/8905065399_d00b91d1e6_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 2 - May - 02" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Arguably the standard format for these sorts of noise boxes is for them to be a drone noise box. [demo] [&#8230;] What we wanted to do with these, this particular model, is make something that&#8217;s a bit more <em>playable</em>, so you can be quite rhythmical. [demo]&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about our Game Controller format synths]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s simulating what it is like if the battery goes flat. [&#8230;] controlling the amount of flatness your battery has, rather than having to have a selection of batteries that you pop in.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about power-starve on our synths]</span></p>
<p>All the synths we build have at least one oscillator wired out to two photo ports, to allow the functionality to be extended via anything that provides a resistance value.</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We&#8217;re all going to try and hold hands. [&#8230;] We&#8217;ll see how successful this is.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about the synth extension and touch contacts]</span></p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;the extension allows you to design something that does for you what you want to do in your liveset&#8221;</em><br />

<p>Next up David demonstrated the optical sequencer he has built, which again can wire into the extension port of our synths.</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;we call this, as a sort of working title, the Pocket Oramics&#8221;</em><br />

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Part of the thinking with these is that they can be made cheaply enough so that they can be bought by anyone that wishes to experiment. &#8220;</em><br />

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The suggestion was that you could have one mechanical device that is pulling this strip through and another mechanical device that had a pen on it, which was then writing on it.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about an idea for a generative sequencer suggested at If Wet #1]</span></p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">3D printed tuba mouthpiece</h2>
<p>[34:08 &#8211; 51:04 | Part 1]<br />
During If Wet #2 we were running a &#8220;MarkerBot Replicator 2&#8221; 3D printer at the back of the hall. It printed a tuba mouthpiece. We had a pre-prepared (filed and sanded) version of this mouthpiece with us, which we demonstrated attached to Sam&#8217;s tuba.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tuba.jpg" alt="3D printed tuba mouthpiece" width="625" height="425" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 520px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Quick Google, mouthpiece.stl, oh look somebody has put up a CAD design for a trombone mouthpiece. Trouble is I don&#8217;t know any trombone players. [&#8230;] Quick Google, find out how long a tuba mouthpiece is, take the trombone mouthpiece dimensions and just make one that&#8217;s the same length, and let all the other dimensions go.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The interesting point is you can now choose to do things you couldn&#8217;t normally do with a conventional mouthpiece. [&#8230;] I could take a pressure driver, a loudspeaker in a can, a pipe, build one of these with a pipe attachment and I can now have a sequence of notes playing through here while Sam plays another sequence on the tuba. [&#8230;] I have no idea whether that will sound interesting, horrible, exciting, good, bad, or indifferent, but I bet nobody has done that before.&#8221;</em><br />

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;So a PLA teapot isn&#8217;t quite a chocolate teapot but it&#8217;s well on the way to being a chocolate teapot.&#8221;</em><br />

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Juneau Projects</h1>
<p>[00:35 &#8211; 41:00 | Part 2]<br />
It was a delight having Juneau Projects come down to talk about their project &#8220;Blackbird in Infospace&#8221;, their EP which is downloadable to a USB drive at &#8220;shrines&#8221; throughout Worcester. They also demonstrated their distinctive musical instruments and performed a piece from the EP.</p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;You can go to your computer and get almost anything you want delivered to you. We are not against that, that&#8217;s a great thing, but we we interested in looking at the the other way around and making something that had elements of deliberately slowing down that process.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Phil talking about why they were interested in getting people out and about to download their EP]</span></p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Run What Ya Brung</h1>
<p>[41:32 &#8211; 57:00 | Part 2]<br />
We run a regular feature at If Wet in which members of the audience are invited to bring along and demonstrate instruments, sound objects and sonic oddities. Thanks to Richard for bringing another great piece to If Wet.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Richard Windley</h1>
<p>[58:48 &#8211; 1:02:18 | Part 2]<br />
Richard is a Hereford-based artist/maker who is currently working in the field of technical reproductions, created for television and film. His work and experience spans many years. He brought along two of his Theremins to show us.</p>

<p>Once again, the evening ended with a lot of people sticking around to chat. One of the core aims of If Wet it to build links locally. We are confident there are people who share our interests out there and we&#8217;d like to hook up with them to form some sort of creative community. Another successful If Wet, see you at the next one!</p>
