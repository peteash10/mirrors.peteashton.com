				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first If Wet of 2014 is upon us and it&#8217;s also our first outside of the village hall. On <strong>Saturday 29th March, 3-6pm</strong> we will be at <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/if-wet/" target="_blank">Flatpack Festival</a> in Birmingham. We are delighted to present a double-bill made up of <a href="http://acousticengineering.wordpress.com/trevor-cox/" target="_blank">Trevor Cox</a> and <a href="http://sebastianehegarty.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Sebastiane Hegarty</a>. JOIN US.</p>

<div class="imageTitle">Sonic Wonderland, Trevor Cox</div>
<p>Trevor Cox is Professor of Acoustic Engineering at the University of Salford and author of Sonic Wonderland: A Scientific Odyssey of Sound. His book is contains examples of some of the most fascinating sounds on the planet, including sand dunes that drone and the world&#8217;s longest reverb.</p>
<p>In-keeping with Flatpack&#8217;s aquatic leanings this year, Trevor will present a variety of recordings and stories related, at least loosely, to watery sounds. As ever when Trevor presents there will be a mixture of science and sound, and a deep understanding of and enthusiasm for his subject.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sh.jpg" alt="Sebastiane Hegarty" width="615" height="504" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Rain Choir, Sebastiane Hegarty</div>
<p>We are also delighted to welcome interdisciplinary artist <a href="sebastianehegarty.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Sebastiane Hegarty</a>, who will be presenting a collage of sound and talk around the subject of time and place in relation to sound and field-recording. This will include a presentation of his work Rain Choir, a sound installation he created for the crypt at Winchester Cathedral.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/one-water.jpg" alt="One Water" width="615" height="410" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">One Water, MortonUnderwood</div>
<p>Your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will be presenting their One Water instrument, which was commissioned by Swedish composer <a href="http://www.soundweather.net/" target="_blank">Jonas Asplund</a>. Their brief: &#8220;make me an instrument that uses water in the way it makes sound&#8221;.</p>
<p>We will also have our regular Run What Ya Brung section where anyone can do a brief, informal presentation of a sonic curiosity they might own or have built. Please JOIN US and contribute!
