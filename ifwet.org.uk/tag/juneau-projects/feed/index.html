				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If Wet #2 was a slightly more intimate affair than If Wet #1. The first hot day for ages and a bank holiday Sunday surely didn&#8217;t help in terms of numbers but we had a fun and informative time hosting the wonderful Juneau Projects.</p>
<p>Here is the full audio recording, in two parts: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-2-part-1" target="_blank"><strong>Part1</strong></a> / <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-2-part-2" target="_blank"><strong>Part2</strong></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of what went on, so you can access topics of interest:</p>
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/8905089099/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7415/8905089099_2c25a85430_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 2 - May - 10" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 520px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;If at any point in proceedings you want to interject, ask a question, just stick your hand up. We have a very open forum throughout all of this!&#8221;</em></p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">MortonUnderwood present&#8230;</h1>
<p>[2:52 &#8211; 51:20 | Part 1]</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Noise box synths and optical sequencer</h2>
<p>[2:52 &#8211; 34:08 | Part 1]<br />
We brought along three of our Game Conroller noise box synths, a stereo noise box (codenamed THE BEAST), a controller in a Spam tin and our prototype optical sequencer to demo.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/8905065399/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8560/8905065399_d00b91d1e6_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 2 - May - 02" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 520px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Arguably the standard format for these sorts of noise boxes is for them to be a drone noise box. [demo] [&#8230;] What we wanted to do with these, this particular model, is make something that&#8217;s a bit more <em>playable</em>, so you can be quite rhythmical. [demo]&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about our Game Controller format synths]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s simulating what it is like if the battery goes flat. [&#8230;] controlling the amount of flatness your battery has, rather than having to have a selection of batteries that you pop in.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about power-starve on our synths]</span></p>
<p>All the synths we build have at least one oscillator wired out to two photo ports, to allow the functionality to be extended via anything that provides a resistance value.</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We&#8217;re all going to try and hold hands. [&#8230;] We&#8217;ll see how successful this is.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about the synth extension and touch contacts]</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/8905695848/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7432/8905695848_f0f623d12b_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 2 - May - 06" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 520px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;the extension allows you to design something that does for you what you want to do in your liveset&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about the synth extension and how it allows for easy controller customisation]</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/8905699822/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7339/8905699822_1ca821d700_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 2 - May - 07" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>

<p>Next up David demonstrated the optical sequencer he has built, which again can wire into the extension port of our synths.</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;we call this, as a sort of working title, the Pocket Oramics&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Referencing part of the history surrounding our optical sequencer]</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/8905708608/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/8905708608_079b14b813_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 2 - May - 11" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Part of the thinking with these is that they can be made cheaply enough so that they can be bought by anyone that wishes to experiment. &#8220;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about our optical sequencer relative to others before it]</span></p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The suggestion was that you could have one mechanical device that is pulling this strip through and another mechanical device that had a pen on it, which was then writing on it.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about an idea for a generative sequencer suggested at If Wet #1]</span></p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">3D printed tuba mouthpiece</h2>
<p>[34:08 &#8211; 51:04 | Part 1]<br />
During If Wet #2 we were running a &#8220;MarkerBot Replicator 2&#8221; 3D printer at the back of the hall. It printed a tuba mouthpiece. We had a pre-prepared (filed and sanded) version of this mouthpiece with us, which we demonstrated attached to Sam&#8217;s tuba.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tuba.jpg" alt="3D printed tuba mouthpiece" width="625" height="425" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 520px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Quick Google, mouthpiece.stl, oh look somebody has put up a CAD design for a trombone mouthpiece. Trouble is I don&#8217;t know any trombone players. [&#8230;] Quick Google, find out how long a tuba mouthpiece is, take the trombone mouthpiece dimensions and just make one that&#8217;s the same length, and let all the other dimensions go.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The interesting point is you can now choose to do things you couldn&#8217;t normally do with a conventional mouthpiece. [&#8230;] I could take a pressure driver, a loudspeaker in a can, a pipe, build one of these with a pipe attachment and I can now have a sequence of notes playing through here while Sam plays another sequence on the tuba. [&#8230;] I have no idea whether that will sound interesting, horrible, exciting, good, bad, or indifferent, but I bet nobody has done that before.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about the melting point of 3D printed PLA material]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;So a PLA teapot isn&#8217;t quite a chocolate teapot but it&#8217;s well on the way to being a chocolate teapot.&#8221;</em><br />

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Juneau Projects</h1>
<p>[00:35 &#8211; 41:00 | Part 2]<br />
It was a delight having Juneau Projects come down to talk about their project &#8220;Blackbird in Infospace&#8221;, their EP which is downloadable to a USB drive at &#8220;shrines&#8221; throughout Worcester. They also demonstrated their distinctive musical instruments and performed a piece from the EP.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/8905725762/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2828/8905725762_cce4ac423c_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 2 - May - 17" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;You can go to your computer and get almost anything you want delivered to you. We are not against that, that&#8217;s a great thing, but we we interested in looking at the the other way around and making something that had elements of deliberately slowing down that process.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Phil talking about why they were interested in getting people out and about to download their EP]</span></p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Run What Ya Brung</h1>
<p>[41:32 &#8211; 57:00 | Part 2]<br />
We run a regular feature at If Wet in which members of the audience are invited to bring along and demonstrate instruments, sound objects and sonic oddities. Thanks to Richard for bringing another great piece to If Wet.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Richard Windley</h1>
<p>[58:48 &#8211; 1:02:18 | Part 2]<br />
Richard is a Hereford-based artist/maker who is currently working in the field of technical reproductions, created for television and film. His work and experience spans many years. He brought along two of his Theremins to show us.</p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;You make the first iteration of it, you think that&#8217;s good if I did a Mark2 it would be that much better but you never get around to making a Mark2. On to the next project.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about his creative process]</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.richardwindley.co.uk/" target="_blank">richardwindley.co.uk</a></p>
<p>Once again, the evening ended with a lot of people sticking around to chat. One of the core aims of If Wet it to build links locally. We are confident there are people who share our interests out there and we&#8217;d like to hook up with them to form some sort of creative community. Another successful If Wet, see you at the next one!</p>

<p>This Sunday (26/05) we will host our second If Wet. We are delighted to have Juneau Projects appearing to talk about their &#8220;Blackbird in Infospace&#8221; project, a Worcester-based USB downloadable album &#8211; further info <a href="http://www.worcester.ac.uk/discover/juneau-projects-launch-blackbird-in-infospace.html" target="_blank">here</a>. They will also discuss their distinctive musical instruments and deliver a short performance.</p>

<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 470px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Juneau Projects, instrument</div>
<p>As usual the evening will start with your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> presenting an area of their work. This time it&#8217;s all about their synths. They will be showcasing a series of noise box synths and associated kit, and hope to provide a demo of them used in a musical context. They will also unveil their most comprehensively specified synth to date, codenamed<br />
THE BEAST.</p>

<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 340px; margin-bottom: 30px;">MortonUnderwood, synth (owned by Stephen O&#8217;Malley)</div>
<p>We will also have our regular Run What Ya Brung section where anyone can do a brief, informal presentation of a sonic curiosity they might own or have built (<a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/the-live-birth-of-if-wet/" target="_blank">last month we had a carrot recorder and a kinetic sculpture</a>) and we hope to finish with a Sonic Exchange and panel discussion, if time permits.</p>
<p>Oh, and it&#8217;s a bank holiday Sunday and a damn nice part of the country. So, why not consider <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/make-a-day-of-it/" target="_blank">making a day</a> of your trip? </p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall, this Sunday, 5pm.</p>
