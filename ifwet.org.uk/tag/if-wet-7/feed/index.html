				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long until If Wet #7; <strong>Sunday 27th October, 2-4pm</strong>. For our penultimate event of our first season we have a double-bill made up of the fabulous <a href="http://www.helenwhitedesign.com/" target="_blank">Helen White</a> and <a href="http://www.soundsurvey.org.uk/" target="_blank">Ian Rawes</a>. JOIN US.</p>

<div class="imageTitle">Solar-wind Chime, Helen White</div>
<p>Inspired by recent media attention on solar flares and their effects on both positive and predicted negative events (the northern lights / technological disruption), Helen has been exploring creative ways to respond to this natural phenomena. She will be presenting her &#8216;solar-wind&#8217; chime, a slowly-evolving resonating sculpture that responds in real-time to solar wind data collected from a satellite an hour away from earth, and she&#8217;ll be talking about working with complicated scientific principles and aesthetically bereft data sources that finally led her to listen to the sun.</p>

<p>By day Ian Rawes works in the sound archive at the British Library. He also runs <a href="http://www.soundsurvey.org.uk/" target="_blank">London Sound Survey</a>, a growing collection of Creative Commons-licensed sound recordings of places, events and wildlife in the capital.</p>

<div class="imageTitle">London Sound Survey, Ian Rawes</div>
<p>Ian will present a series of rarely-heard and never-heard archival recordings of vanished customs and daily life from London in the 1920s to the 1950s. Performing dogs, fortune tellers, Mike Stern the mayor of Petticoat Lane, lavender sellers, the singing sewer workers of the New Kent Road, Commander Daniel&#8217;s noise nuisances, Godfrey the bagpipe king and how London Zoo&#8217;s animals helped win the war.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mu.jpg" alt="Sound Trolley" width="615" height="443" /></p>
<p>Your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will be presenting the Sound Trolley they built for their recent artist residency at the Library of Birmingham.</p>
<p>We will also have our regular Run What Ya Brung section where anyone can do a brief, informal presentation of a sonic curiosity they might own or have built. Last month we had Richard Windley with and acoustic guitar (!) and harp combo he had made. Please JOIN US and contribute!</p>
<p>We will also have the usual yummy treats of home-made food, cakes and a local ale.</p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall on Sunday the 27th October at 2pm! Tickets on the door.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
