				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking we have resolved not to document remote If Wets. There is a lot involved in putting them on and in our local hall we know better what we face. This means the If Wets at <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/if-wet-at-flatpack-preview/" target="_blank">Flatpack Festival</a> and the <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/if-wet-at-southbank-preview/" target="_blank">Southbank Centre</a> are documented only in preview form and in the memories of their attendees.</p>
<p>If Wet at Supersonic is a little different, though, because Sam normally contributes a rambling blog post to the <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com/news/supersonic-festival-2014-collective-memory/2014/" target ="_blank">Supersonic Collective Memory</a>, so we felt we ought to provide a few photos (taken by David during the event) at least.</p>
<p>We spoke about our project <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com/news/descent-morton-underwood/2014/" target="_blank">Descent</a> first. If you are very quick you may still catch it at Millenium Point.</p>
<p>Then we had <a href="https://vimeo.com/42044785" target="_blank">Sarah Kenchington</a> talk, followed by <a href="http://nnnnn.org.uk/doku.php" target="_blank">Ryan Jordan</a>. This led on to an extended Run What Ya Brung section, co-run by <a href="http://stryx.co.uk/" target="_blank">Stryx</a>, with presentations by various artists. The day finished with wonderful performances by Sarah Kenchington and <a href="http://grahamdunning.com/" target="_blank">Graham Dunning</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures and a few lines about what went on.</p>

<p>We have rooted around for some reviews but most reviewers seem to have stuck to the main stages. Here are a couple of exceptions &#8211; <a href="http://echoesanddust.com/2014/06/o-festival-review-supersonic-custard-factory-birmingham-30th-31st-may-2014/" target="_blank">1</a> / <a href="http://thequietus.com/articles/15478-supersonic-festival-2014-review" target="_blank">2</a>.</p>
<p>We enjoyed what the former said of Sarah Kenchington, <em>&#8220;It really felt like she summed up everything Supersonic was actually about &#8211; pushing the limits of what music is and how we should think about it.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It was a delight to behold. Thank you to everyone who presented and performed, and to all of you who came to witness it.</p>
<p>Next up, we are off on tour to four village halls across the country. We are delighted with the line-up. <strong>Have a look and buy tickets <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/if-wet-2014-tour-preview/" target="_blank">HERE</a></strong>. JOIN US.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have never published an If Wet preview so close to an event before but we wanted to tell you because we are delighted with the extended line-up and events we have put together for <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com/" target="_blank">Supersonic Festival</a> &#8211; taking place tomorrow, 31st May 2014. JOIN US. The day will go something like this:</p>
<p>We will kick things off as usual, demonstrating our latest piece of work, <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com/line-up/exhibitions/descent-morton-underwood" target="_blank">Descent</a>, which you can actually go and use during the time of the festival.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sarah.jpg" alt="Sarah Kenchington" width="614" height="699" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Sarah Kenchington</div>
<p>The first visiting artist to present is Sarah Kenchington. Sarah is a musical instrument builder. She makes wondrous acoustic machines, which she amalgamates into one large instrument that she does solo performances with. It is a sight and sound to behold.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/42044785" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" title="On Another Note" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Sarah will present her work and musical instruments in the salon part of our event, which starts at 5.30pm. She will then delight us with a performance (also in the Theatre Space) from around 8:45pm.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ryan.jpg" alt="ryan" width="614" height="391" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Ryan Jordan</div>
<p>Next up we have Ryan Jordan, who is a noise artist working with derelict electronics. He is also an instrument maker but Ryan&#8217;s work is predominantly electronic; building crude instruments that replicate fundamental electronic components. His sound is very far removed from that created by Sarah but this is what If Wet is all about. We hope you will find parallels in their work that go beyond the end product.</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="352" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VNRJJiapIOo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Ryan will present his work and creations in the salon part of our event, which starts at 5.30pm. He will then perform his liveset on the Second Stage at 8:45pm.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rwyb.jpg" alt="Richard Windley" width="614" height="410" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Richard Windley &#8211; doing a RWYB</div>
<p>From 7.30pm we have the most full-on Run What Ya Brung section ever at an If Wet, with a number of artists presenting work and sonic curiosities. This is co-organised by <a href="http://stryx.co.uk/" target="_blank">Stryx</a>.</p>
<p>We have always been lucky enough to have wonderful work presented in our Run What Ya Brung section. You can expect lots to relish and ponder from this one!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/graham.jpg" alt="graham" width="614" height="410" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Graham Dunning</div>
<p>Lastly, we are delighted to welcome Graham Dunning back to If Wet. Graham will perform a set for us using his latest set-up; a sort of mechanical techno thing. This will take place in the Theatre Space from 9.45pm.</p>
<p>I have no doubt we can convince Graham to explain it more on the night but here is a video to whet your appetite.</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="352" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXlOZeU-ZqA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>We hope to see many friendly, and lots of new, faces tomorrow. JOIN US.</p>
