<p>We are having to delay the start of our <a href="fundraiser.ifwet.org.uk" target="_blank">fundraiser</a> by 30 minutes, due to a double-booking made by the people who organise the village hall. As a result we will only be able to get into the hall at 5pm and we are told they will still be removing a bouncy castle at the time! This might make things a little more shambolic/charming in general as we wont have the time we&#8217;d hoped to set up and test &#8211; but we&#8217;ll manage. If you do arrive at 5pm you will of course be welcomed in but please consider delaying until 5:30pm if you can.</p>
<p>Once in, grab yourself a drink, make yourself comfortable and we will start around 6pm with a presentation by your hosts MortonUnderwood.</p>
<p>Apologies for any inconvenience caused. See you soon!</p>
<p><em>The whole bouncy castle inside a village hall thing had passed us by but the image above is in fact of Callow End Village Hall.</em></p>

			<p>Our final If Wet of the season is fast approaching; <strong>SATURDAY 30th November, 5.30pm &#8211; 11pm</strong>. <em>Note: <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/fundraiser-start-delayed-until-530pm/" target="_blank">slight delay</a> in starting due to a bouncy castle.</em></p>
<p>For our final event we have a much extended offering, on a Saturday, so people can join us in celebrating our first season. By coming to this special fundraising event you will be helping to make our second season happen.</p>
<p>There will be presentations and discussion, much like a normal If Wet, but this event will feature musical performances more centrally.</p>
<p>JOIN US for a night of sonic exploration and wonderment >> <a href="https://ifwet-fundraiser.eventbrite.co.uk" target="_blank">Tickets here</a> </p>
<p><strong>Line-up:</strong><br />
Sarah Angliss / Isle of Everywhere / ORE / Nimzo-Indian / Soundhog (DJ) / MortonUnderwood</p>
<h1>MortonUnderwood</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/david.jpg" alt="Morton" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Morton</div>

<div class="imageTitle">Underwood</div>
<p>Your every faithful hosts, <a href="http://mortonunderwood.co.uk" title="MortonUnderwood" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will welcome you to the final If Wet of the season with a smile &#8211; all being well. The evening will start with some time for guests (new and old) to mingle and settle into the space and pace of the village hall &#8211; and explore the various goodies in the fundraising auction etc. We will then present a celebratory review of the previous events before moving on to showcase stuff that will feature in the fundraising auction. Then, the latest presentation of work by MortonUnderwood.</p>
<h1>Nimzo-Indian</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mini-guitar.jpg" alt="Nimzo-Indian" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Nimzo-Indian</div>
<p>Next up there will be a presentation and live performance by Nimzo-Indian, an alter-ego of artist and technologist <a href="http://fatsuma.co.uk/pages/frame2.html" target="_blank">Fatsuma</a>. Andy will discuss his work and present four mini guitars he has built, before going on to deliver an unpredictable performance with them.</p>
<p><em>At this point we&#8217;ll break for some refreshments. Hot food and drinks will be provided, as will cakes, snacks, wine, local ale and soft drinks.</em></p>
<h1>ORE</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ore.jpg" alt="ORE" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">ORE</div>
<p>With your belly full of grub, ease into a satiated transcendental state with a live set from drone doom tuba duo <a href="http://www.oretubadoom.com" target="_blank">ORE</a>. Again there will be a brief discussion about their ethos and working method ahead of the performance.</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F107308486&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938"></iframe></p>
<h1>Isle of Everywhere</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ioe.jpg" alt="Isle of Everywhere" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Isle of Everywhere</div>
<p>After ORE we are delighted to welcome back a band that were at our inaugural If Wet in April, the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/IsleOfE" target="_blank">Isle of Everywhere</a> (duo). They feature Stuart on tuba (if he has any puff left after playing with ORE) and Simon on santur. A rare combination; together in dub. <em>Note: this is a duo performance without Lydia on drums.</em></p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/66818452" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" title="Hammered Tubstep" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h1>Sarah Angliss</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sarah1.jpg" alt="Sarah Angliss" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Sarah Angliss</div>
<p>Our last live act of the evening is <a href="http://www.sarahangliss.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Angliss</a>. Her last appearance at If Wet was a delight to behold and we are very pleased to welcome her back; only this time the emphasis will be much more on performance rather than discussion of working methods &#8211; although there will be a element of that too!</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F104099953&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938&#038;in=spacedoguk%2Fsets%2Fsarah-angliss-music-samples-1"></iframe></p>
<h1>Soundhog</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soundhog.jpg" alt="Soundhog" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Soundhog</div>
<p>The rest of the evening will be spent celebrating and discussing, to a soundtrack provided by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundhog" target="_blank">Soundhog</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F39920118&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938"></iframe></p>
<p>We are not really sure what more we can do to entice you to our village hall; it should be a really distinctive experience. Step out of your world and into ours for a night. </p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall on Saturday the 30th November at 5pm! Tickets on the door, £14. Or we have a few other ticket options available <a href="https://ifwet-fundraiser.eventbrite.co.uk" target="_blank">on-line</a> </p>

			<p>If Wet #6 was an intimate affair but we the presentations were stellar. Thanks to those who came and to those who presented &#8211; you did us proud.</p>
<p>Here is the full audio recording, in two parts: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-6-part-1" target="_blank"><strong>Part1</strong></a> / <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-6-part-2" target="_blank"><strong>Part2</strong></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of what went on, so you can access topics of interest:</p>

<p>[1:30 &#8211; 22:05 | Part 1]</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;In April of this year I was appointed as the Artist-in-Residence at the Town Hall Symphony Hall in Birmingham, [&#8230;] because they don&#8217;t do weird very well.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The police were about to send in a robot [&#8230;] to blow it up!&#8221;</em><br />

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We didn&#8217;t want to put labels saying this is the microphone, this is the record button, this is the loudspeaker; we wanted it to be something you could intuit.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[David discussing our &#8216;A Word In Your Ear&#8217; sound art piece]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;This is what happens when Sam and I have a 20 minute phone call about how we might put it in a box and what we might do about the user interface to make it easy to tell which bit to speak into. It&#8217;s quite worrying really that it winds up looking like something out of a David Cronenberg movie.&#8221;</em></p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Soundhog</h1>
<p>[22:20 &#8211; 1:01:25 | Part 1]<br />
Ben Soundhog introduced his production techniques and work on his piece <em>Whole Lotta Helter Skelter</em> bastard pop piece.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ifwet6-16.jpg" alt="Soundhog" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: George Benson</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve always had this kind of fascination with messing up other people&#8217;s work, whether they like it or not.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I used to have an Atari 800 [&#8230;] and you could have I think it was 7 seconds in total in samples, which you then split up into eight [&#8230;] but there was enough there so you could start nicking notes off people&#8217;s records. &#8220;</em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ifwet6-26.jpg" alt="Soundhog" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: George Benson</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;He put out two singles out. They were both under the counter because they were, in terms of copyright, completely illegal.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It has gone into the mainstream. I hear stuff now using whacking great big chunks of other peoples music. That is a direct line from what we were doing; it did have an effect. We were always hoping that we&#8217;d get involved but of course what happens in the music industry, they take it themselves, they squish it down into something they can deal with and then they make the money out of it &#8211; then they are all happy.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ifwet6-35.jpg" alt="Soundhog" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: George Benson</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;This is why everybody would use stuff like the Beastie Boys because the vocal tracks were easily available; they were always on the B-side of the 12 inch single. [&#8230;] But what has happened in recent years [&#8230;] there were a couple of console games out, one called Rock Band and one called Guitar Hero, [&#8230;] and this is how much clout the gaming industry developed, they actually were able to go to the record companies dig out the multi-track masters and use them as the basis of the samples in the game.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I know a lot of people don&#8217;t like you messing with things that are, you know, sacred but [&#8230;] it&#8217;s not like the originals don&#8217;t exist any more.  If you want to hear it as it is then it&#8217;s there for you but if you want just something a bit different then so long as it&#8217;s not a complete mess I think you should be able to have a go at this.&#8221;</em></p>

<div class="imageTitle">Photo: George Benson</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;To be honest I&#8217;ve never had much feedback from people but one of the guitar players out of Paul McCartney&#8217;s current touring band, which is fantastic, and Jimmy Page&#8217;s website had it on their front page, so they must be alright with it.&#8221;</em></p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Graham Dunning</h1>
<p>[00:10 &#8211; 53:35 | Part 2]<br />
Graham Dunning discusses and demonstrates his project <em>Music by the Metre</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ifwet6-44.jpg" alt="Graham Dunning" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: George Benson</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s based on an idea by Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio, [&#8230;] he&#8217;s founding member of the situationist movement and Italian painter and also chemist and he came up with industrial painting, Painting by the Metre. [&#8230;] My version is an audio homage to that technique.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some machines which create some abstract music which I then use to fill up a spool of tape. [&#8230;] So what I&#8217;ll do is set up the machines until it&#8217;s making something resembling something musical and then that&#8217;s the end of my intervention with it. [&#8230;] I just leave it to run, fill up all of one side of the tape and then turn it over and fill up the other side.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ifwet6-51.jpg" alt="Graham Dunning" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: George Benson</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The idea of vertical music is that it&#8217;s always changing but it&#8217;s always the same, and it&#8217;s never changing but it&#8217;s never the same.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I am going to set up one of these machines now today and as I go along I am going to describe what the sources are. So, I&#8217;ll just start doing that.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ifwet6-52.jpg" alt="Graham Dunning" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: George Benson</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I am also using a rock from just outside to hold the back end of the tonearm hopefully to make it loop on the same bit so it doesn&#8217;t spiral towards the middle.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Next up, I&#8217;ve got another turntable, which has been slightly butchered. [&#8230;] I&#8217;ve taken out the original motor and have put in this kind of hobby motor, which has an adjustable speed on it. [&#8230;] It goes from quite slow to being much faster than a normal record player.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Just trying to find a certain record. They are all unlabelled so I can&#8217;t remember which one it was. [&#8230;] These are some dubplates that I got made of different field recordings I recorded myself. [&#8230;] This is the sound of, I put some cymbals out in the rain each with a contact mic on.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The longer you listen to it the more you can hear.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ifwet6-54.jpg" alt="Graham Dunning" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: George Benson</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;This microphone is going out the window to get some traffic noise, or in a more academic way of putting it, live environmental sound.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;There is quite a nice sweep to even regular traffic and I think in the context of quite a noise-heavy conversation between these different sounds it can change the composition. [&#8230;] Over the course of the tape it&#8217;s actually different all the way through.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ifwet6-56.jpg" alt="Graham Dunning" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: George Benson</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;One final element, inside this tape is a loop of cassette. [&#8230;] This is from a remix I did for a saxophone player called Colin Webster. [&#8230;] To remix one of his tracks I recorded it out to tape and then made up sixteen of these cassettes of little snippets and then played eight of them together. [&#8230;] All slightly different, so they go in and out of sync together.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;So, I am happy with that as the composition as it is going to be. The last bit to do is switch the tape on so, start it running and just leave it recording until it has filled both sides of the tape.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;That&#8217;s it, it&#8217;s going and it&#8217;s out of my hands!.&#8221;</em></p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Run What Ya Brung</h1>
<p>[54:54 &#8211; 01:03:54 | Part 2]<br />
We run a regular feature at If Wet in which members of the audience are invited to bring along and demonstrate instruments, sound objects and sonic oddities. This month we had a great contribution from our regular contributor Richard Windley.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 130%;">Richard Windley</h1>
<p>[54:54 &#8211; 01:03:54 | Part 2]</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a couple of quite nice handmade guitars that I&#8217;ve had for years and I&#8217;ve gradually got more and more frustrated with them. [&#8230;] I thought maybe I&#8217;d better design one that I like [&#8230;] so I designed and built this one a few years ago. [&#8230;] This thing I&#8217;ve only added recently and it was an attempt to do this thing which Indian instruments and some European instruments like hurdy gurdies often have these things called sympathetic strings [&#8230;] to broaden the range of the sound and to give me more sustain.&#8221;</em></p>

			<p>Not long until If Wet #7; <strong>Sunday 27th October, 2-4pm</strong>. For our penultimate event of our first season we have a double-bill made up of the fabulous <a href="http://www.helenwhitedesign.com/" target="_blank">Helen White</a> and <a href="http://www.soundsurvey.org.uk/" target="_blank">Ian Rawes</a>. JOIN US.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/hw-s.jpg" alt="Helen White" width="694" height="392" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Solar-wind Chime, Helen White</div>
<p>Inspired by recent media attention on solar flares and their effects on both positive and predicted negative events (the northern lights / technological disruption), Helen has been exploring creative ways to respond to this natural phenomena. She will be presenting her &#8216;solar-wind&#8217; chime, a slowly-evolving resonating sculpture that responds in real-time to solar wind data collected from a satellite an hour away from earth, and she&#8217;ll be talking about working with complicated scientific principles and aesthetically bereft data sources that finally led her to listen to the sun.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/65346809" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>By day Ian Rawes works in the sound archive at the British Library. He also runs <a href="http://www.soundsurvey.org.uk/" target="_blank">London Sound Survey</a>, a growing collection of Creative Commons-licensed sound recordings of places, events and wildlife in the capital.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lss.gif" alt="London Sound Survey" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">London Sound Survey, Ian Rawes</div>
<p>Ian will present a series of rarely-heard and never-heard archival recordings of vanished customs and daily life from London in the 1920s to the 1950s. Performing dogs, fortune tellers, Mike Stern the mayor of Petticoat Lane, lavender sellers, the singing sewer workers of the New Kent Road, Commander Daniel&#8217;s noise nuisances, Godfrey the bagpipe king and how London Zoo&#8217;s animals helped win the war.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mu.jpg" alt="Sound Trolley" width="615" height="443" /></p>
<p>Your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will be presenting the Sound Trolley they built for their recent artist residency at the Library of Birmingham.</p>
<p>We will also have our regular Run What Ya Brung section where anyone can do a brief, informal presentation of a sonic curiosity they might own or have built. Last month we had Richard Windley with and acoustic guitar (!) and harp combo he had made. Please JOIN US and contribute!</p>
<p>We will also have the usual yummy treats of home-made food, cakes and a local ale.</p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall on Sunday the 27th October at 2pm! Tickets on the door.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Oh and <a href="https://ifwet-fundraiser.eventbrite.co.uk/" target="_blank">GET YOUR TICKETS NOW</a> for our final event of our first season&#8230;a fundraiser for Season #2 no less! Or feel free to just donate to the cause. THANKS.</p>

			<p>If Wet #5 was an unusually interactive event &#8211; people even went outside! <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">We</a> merely introduced this If Wet, with no further input. As ever our guests did us proud.</p>
<p>Here is the full audio recording, in three parts: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-5-part-1" target="_blank"><strong>Part1</strong></a> / <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-5-part-2" target="_blank"><strong>Part2</strong></a> / <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-5-part-3" target="_blank"><strong>Part3</strong></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of what went on, so you can access topics of interest:</p>
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604477732/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2809/9604477732_50a6eddd9b_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 03" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We set up If Wet [&#8230;] as a bit of an antidote to the rock/blues nights there are throughout the region. We didn&#8217;t really feel there was a requirement for another one of those, so we decided to set this up.&#8221;</em></p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Nikki Pugh</h1>
<p>[03:30 &#8211; 36:45 | Part 1]<br />
Nikki Pugh introduced us to her work related to space and in particular her project <em>Score for heavy objects and built environment</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604482368/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3678/9604482368_d7555765ed_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 06" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;You know there is this whole drive to make technology smaller, more invisible, I just like the idea of going &#8216;Raggghh here it is!&#8217;, and I&#8217;ve got to carry it.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Nikki discussing her huge, heavy tubes used for this project]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Inside them [&#8230;] a micro-controller. As small computer, based on the Arduino platform. It&#8217;s three things really: it&#8217;s little PCBs with computer chips on them, it&#8217;s also software that is designed for artists to use, and a massive support community as well.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604448712/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7439/9604448712_6128da9d8e_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 08" width="640" height="494" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Inside here I&#8217;ve got two GPS receivers [&#8230;] just the raw component. [&#8230;] and a solenoid.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604447102/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7403/9604447102_625c51044b_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 09" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I view these as this kind of expanded, augmented sense, and use it to pull people&#8217;s attention to the built environment around them in different ways. [&#8230;] I walked down New Street in Birmingham and because I was carrying this kind of equipment with me, suddenly noticed OH! there are trees all down New Street. Just because it made me raise my eye-line and look up. [&#8230;] To try and make people tune in in different ways.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We&#8217;re just going to play you some of the data recorded on the walk. [&#8230;] It&#8217;s the data themselves played back in the same way that they tap as you carry them around. [&#8230;] It&#8217;s quite a direct link back to all that sweating and swearing.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Because it&#8217;s quite an abstract process I wanted to give you the opportunity to experience these yourselves.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We all head outside with the Heavy Objects.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Kathy Hinde</h1>
<p>[00:20 &#8211; 55:00 | Part 2]<br />
Kathy Hinde discusses her project <em>Vocal Migrations</em> and the influences that led her to create the project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9601215919/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7453/9601215919_f054c43bd7_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 18" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;My background is working with music and visual art. I&#8217;ve never really wanted to decide between the two, I&#8217;ve always wanted to do both.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I got involved with an organisation called COMMA, which stands for Contemporary Music Making for Amateurs. That&#8217;s using the word amateur in its original meaning, which means for the love of it.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9601214563/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5331/9601214563_fba12f6034_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 19" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We were doing full orchestra pieces that were for wine glasses, fire extinguishers and you know, cellos and violins and pianos. [&#8230;] The way that some of the composers chose to deal with this mixed ensemble of different abilities and maybe odd instrument combinations were really interesting. There were all sorts of different strategies.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;One of the pieces was working with the composer Terry Riley. [&#8230;] COMMA did the UK première of this piece with Terry Riley. [&#8230;] Terry Riley was conducting. Not really realising the significance of how great this guy is; these were really formative experiences.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9601266579/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3805/9601266579_109c901751_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 21" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Moving on to my piece Vocal Migrations, I wanted to work with this idea of an open score.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;There is so much in nature that creates incredible complex beauty that works with very, very simple rules.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s inspired by how bats use sound to see. [&#8230;] There is a guy in America called Daniel Kish who is blind who has taught himself to echolocate using clicks.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604514146/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5521/9604514146_8607be9d42_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 27" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s this idea of creating a situation or a behaviour for people to be immersed in. I think once you remove sight then there is something quite interesting happens in terms of having to trust this device, having to really listen [&#8230;] and there is this point at which you really relax into it, and sort of go I&#8217;m OK, I can just use my listening to these sounds to make sense of my environment.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604511928/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/9604511928_f3df70f72f_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 26" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Run What Ya Brung</h1>
<p>[01:05:14 &#8211; 01:16:45 | Part 2]<br />
We run a regular feature at If Wet in which members of the audience are invited to bring along and demonstrate instruments, sound objects and sonic oddities. This month we had a viola da gamba and recorder piece, an iPhone drone app and a bass string drone instrument.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 130%;">Tim Cranmore and Ange</h1>
<p>[00:30 &#8211; 12:50 | Part 3]<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604515944/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5548/9604515944_a0c8d377e9_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 31" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We are just going to play a bit of music, if I dare mention the word.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The Viola da gamba came before all the other stringed instruments.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fippleflute.co.uk/" target="_blank">fippleflute.co.uk</a></p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 130%;">Simon Gray</h1>
<p>[14:04 &#8211; 21:45 | Part 3]<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604518980/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7420/9604518980_53bdcb3d3f_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 33" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;A lot of us who make drone-based music will have an app called iTablaPro, which as well as having tabla drums has a tanpura, which generates Indian drones. When we are playing drone-based music we don&#8217;t always want to have the Indian sound, we might want an electronic sound.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.star-one.org.uk/" target="_blank">star-one.org.uk</a></p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 130%;">Richard Windley</h1>
<p>[23:10 &#8211; 31:07 | Part 3]<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604471104/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3724/9604471104_81e11e27b1_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 36" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Then I came across this reference to an early instrument called a Trumpet Marine (sic). it was a single stringed instrument and rather than fret it you played the harmonics on it. And then I remembered something a lap steel player showed me and that is if you play a harmonic on an open string and then slide the bar up the harmonic actually follows the note, [&#8230;] which surprised me.&#8221;</em></p>

We have a double-bill for you made up of the fabulous <a href="http://grahamdunning.com/" target="_blank">Graham Dunning</a> and <a href="http://soundhog.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Soundhog</a>. JOIN US.</p>

<div class="imageTitle">Music by the Metre, Graham Dunning</div>
<p>Graham will be presenting his <em>Music by the Metre</em> project, including a live build of a <em>Music by the Metre</em> piece. The project is an homage to situationist Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio who made and sold abstract &#8220;painting by the metre&#8221;.</p>
<p>Each one is a system of sound making machines which will play indefinitely if left to run. The resulting audio is never changing but never the same: loops of different tempos mix with unstable drones and live environmental sound (a mic out of the window) to make a stable but evolving collage. For If Wet Graham will build one of these conglomerate machines and talk through this process.</p>
<p>Graham is also making a run of 10 recycled tapes individually recorded with a different <em>Music by the Metre</em> piece on each side and a handmade cover.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/soundhog.jpg" alt="Soundhog" width="615" height="345" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Soundhog</div>
<p>Soundhog (Ben) is a bit of an unknown quantity in the context of If Wet. In fact, we don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;ll be covering yet. It&#8217;s quite likely Ben doesn&#8217;t know yet either. BUT we do know that he has a wealth of knowledge, a rich history of making Bastard Pop hits, a fascination for antiquated recordings and technologies, and a near encyclopaedic knowledge of pop music. Soundhog doesn&#8217;t come out to play often so miss this at your peril.</p>
<p>Oh, and he only has a Wikipedia page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundhog" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundhog</a></p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F39920118&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938"></iframe></p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ear.jpg" alt="A Word In Your Ear" width="615" height="345" /></p>
<p>All being well, your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will be presenting a few projects they have been working on lately, as part of Sam&#8217;s artist residency at <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/" target="_blank">THSH Birmingham</a>.</p>
<p>We will also have our regular Run What Ya Brung section where anyone can do a brief, informal presentation of a sonic curiosity they might own or have built. Last month we had a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-5-snippet" target="_blank">delightful performance</a> of viola da gamba and recorder music, a phone based drone synthesis tool and a self-made, bass drone string instrument. Please JOIN US and contribute!</p>
<p>We will also have the usual yummy treats of home-made food, cakes and a local ale.</p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall on Sunday the 29th September at 2pm!</p>
<p><a href="http://ifwet6.eventbrite.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tickets can be purchased here</a>.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s just one week until If Wet #5 &#8211; <strong>Sunday 25th August, 2-4pm</strong>. We have a double-bill for you made up of the fabulous <a href="http://kathyhinde.co.uk/" target="_blank">Kathy Hinde</a> and <a href="http://npugh.co.uk/" target="_blank">Nikki Pugh</a>. JOIN US.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/vm-preview.jpg" alt="Vocal Migrations" width="615" height="407"  /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Vocal Migrations, Kathy Hinde</div>
<p>Kathy will be presenting her <em>Vocal Migrations</em> work, which combines live singing with electronically altered voices and is inspired by how bats &#8216;Echo-locate&#8217; by using sound to &#8216;see&#8217; their surroundings. The results and implications for music and performance are fascinating. Oh and Kathy has also been using the technology to help people navigate spaces without using their vision.</p>
<p>Come and experience this first hand!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/np-preview.jpg" alt="Score for heavy objects and built environment" width="615" height="461" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Score for heavy objects and built environment, Nikki Pugh</div>
<p>Nikki will be presenting her work <em>Score for heavy objects and built environment</em>. As I have experienced before from Nikki this project required some lugging around of odd GPS-enabled objects in preparation (see image above).</p>
<p>Come and hear the results! </p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/route.gif" alt="Route" width="615" height="505" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Score for heavy objects and built environment, route</div>
<p>Your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> are taking a bit of a back seat for this one, but you can never be quite sure what we might bring along!</p>
<p>We will also have our regular Run What Ya Brung section where anyone can do a brief, informal presentation of a sonic curiosity they might own or have built. Last month we had a (rare-as-rocking-horse-dung) Stroh guitar demonstrated by Richard Windley. Please JOIN US and contribute!</p>
<p>We will also have the usual yummy treats of home-made food, cakes and a local ale.</p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall on Sunday the 25th August at 2pm!</p>
