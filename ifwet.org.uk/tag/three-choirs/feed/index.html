				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our third If Wet of the season saw us hosting a special event as part of <a href="http://www.3choirs.org/" target="_blank">Three Choirs Festival</a>. The turnout was heart-warming with the venue having to be changed twice due to over subscription.</p>
<p>This event focussed on the Theremin and we were delighted to have leading player and aficionado Lydia Kavina as our guest. We explored the sound of the Theremin and how other sounds / synths are sometimes mistaken for one. We then looked at similarities between the timbre of the Theremin and the human voice; culminating in a duet between Lydia and singer Emily Prosser &#8211; <em>pictured below</em>.</p>
<p>We will leave any further description of the event to The Jazz Mann, who provided this <a href="http://www.thejazzmann.com/features/article/music-and-...-the-theremin/" target="_blank">in-depth review</a>; for which we are very grateful. </p>

<p><strong>Thank you to Lydia, Emily and Three Choirs for helping us put this event on.</strong> And to all those who attended! We had a great time.</p>

<p>We are firm in the belief that any decision we make regarding our projects is open to review at a later date, and when we came to assess our plans for our third season of monthly If Wet events in the village hall we decided we would put these on ice; and save our Kickstarter cherry for another day. There are various reasons for this decision but central to it is the fact that doing a regular event each month is really time-consuming and energy-sapping. If Wet was intended to drive our own making, for demonstration at the events, but the regular monthly events actually stifled our own building of stuff in 2014; so for now we have put them on hold.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean an end to If Wet events in 2015. In fact, we have a few really exciting events lined up already and we are looking for more. Here are some dates for your diaries:</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 110%;">If Wet at Maker Faire</strong><br />
<em>Saturday 25th – Sunday 26th April</em><br />
A series of If Wet demonstrations and performances over the two days of the festival, taking place at the Centre for Life, Newcastle upon Tyne.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 110%;">If Wet hosts John Doran</strong><br />
<em>Sunday 10th May</em><br />
An all-day special event in our home venue of Callow End Village Hall. Including an If Wet salon, followed by an event featuring Arabrot performing an ambient set featuring John Doran reading from his new book <em>Jolly Lad</em>, due out early May on Strange Attractor Press. Yes, this is happening in Callow End!</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 110%;">If Wet at Three Choirs+</strong><br />
<em>Thursday 30th July</em><br />
A one-off If Wet event on the Theremin as part of the Three Choirs+ programme in Hereford. Further details soon.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 110%;">If Wet at Worcester Music Festival</strong><br />
<em>Sunday 20th September</em><br />
Plans are afoot for If Wet to revisit Worcester Music Festival (and hopefully the glorious Quaker Friends Meeting House) for the second year running.</p>
<p>There are a couple more events in the offing and we welcome anyone <a href="mailto: hello@ifwet.org.uk">getting in touch</a> if you&#8217;d like to discuss us programming and hosting an If Wet as part of your event, wherever you are in the world!</p>
<p>We also started a regular monthly radio programme on <a href="http://www.soundartradio.org.uk/" target="_blank">Sound Art Radio</a> in December 2014, which is broadcast on the last Sunday of the month from 2-4pm; each programme featuring a different musical instrument. More information on that here: <a href="http://radio.ifwet.org.uk" target="_blank">radio.ifwet.org.uk</a></p>
<p>We welcome any suggestions for the radio show and we look forward to seeing you at an If Wet in 2015!</p>
<p>JOIN US.</p>
<p>Sam and David.</p>
