<p>With a little help from our friends [<a href="http://www.soundandmusic.org/" target="_blank">Sound and Music</a>] we will be taking some t-shirts on our tour&#8230;</p>
<p>These were designed by the wonderful Julian James [<a href="http://newsugar.co.uk/" target="_blank">New Sugar</a>] and are based on a phrase David is often heard uttering to Sam, whenever he expresses a view about a matter of taste: <em>You&#8217;re no yardstick</em>. One day we realised that this probably applies to most people we know and to the majority of people inclined to attend an If Wet.</p>
<p>Remembering that you are no yardstick is important when assessing the world around you. In case you should ever forget, you will have it written on your t-shirt. Maybe we can proudly reject the yardstick together?</p>
<p>On the road, these will be on sale for £10 [Heavy Gildan t-shirt] and will come with a little tag saying you bought them on our 2014 Tour of village halls. If you can&#8217;t make it to a <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/if-wet-2014-tour-full-line-up/" target="_blank">tour date</a>, these can be purchased for £13 (inc. P&#038;P). The first run will be of 100 t-shirts, of various sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Please <strong><a href="mailto: hello@ifwet.org.uk?subject=I'm no yardstick - T-shirt order">email us</a></strong> if you are interested in ordering one, stating your preferred size.</strong> <em><br />
All proceeds towards funding future If Wets. We have three more to fund this season alone</em>&#8230;</p>
