<p>With a little help from our friends [<a href="http://www.soundandmusic.org/" target="_blank">Sound and Music</a>] we will be taking some t-shirts on our tour&#8230;</p>
<p>These were designed by the wonderful Julian James [<a href="http://newsugar.co.uk/" target="_blank">New Sugar</a>] and are based on a phrase David is often heard uttering to Sam, whenever he expresses a view about a matter of taste: <em>You&#8217;re no yardstick</em>. One day we realised that this probably applies to most people we know and to the majority of people inclined to attend an If Wet.</p>
<p>Remembering that you are no yardstick is important when assessing the world around you. In case you should ever forget, you will have it written on your t-shirt. Maybe we can proudly reject the yardstick together?</p>
<p>On the road, these will be on sale for £10 [Heavy Gildan t-shirt] and will come with a little tag saying you bought them on our 2014 Tour of village halls. If you can&#8217;t make it to a <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/if-wet-2014-tour-full-line-up/" target="_blank">tour date</a>, these can be purchased for £13 (inc. P&#038;P). The first run will be of 100 t-shirts, of various sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Please <strong><a href="mailto: hello@ifwet.org.uk?subject=I'm no yardstick - T-shirt order">email us</a></strong> if you are interested in ordering one, stating your preferred size.</strong> <em><br />
All proceeds towards funding future If Wets. We have three more to fund this season alone</em>&#8230;</p>

<h1>Friends!</h1>
<p>We will soon enter our second season of If Wet events. The details of this are still very much to be defined but here is our <a href=http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/if-wet-2014/ target="_blank">statement of intent</a>. As you can see we could be doing quite a few events, including a number away from home.</p>
<p>We have some people in mind that we would like to invite to present (Sarah Kenchington and Paul Granjon are high on Sam&#8217;s list) but we&#8217;d love to hear your suggestions too. So, if you know someone who you think does interesting sonic work and could present it for around one hour in a relaxed village hall setting, please pop names, links and details in the comments field below. We welcome your suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-onwards_thankyou2.jpg" alt="Thank You" width="615" height="236" /></p>
<p>We did it! From what started as a bit of experiment, we seemed to build some momentum over our first season, topped off by our Season Finale and Fundraiser event at the end of November 2013. It was a stressful event, due in part to <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/fundraiser-start-delayed-until-530pm/" target="_blank">this</a>, but it also felt like a triumphant celebration of all we had achieved in our first season. Many fond memories, and we even raised some money.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everyone who made our first season and fundraiser a success. People were generous beyond our wildest expectations. Below is a picture of Sarah Angliss playing at our fundraiser. Sarah has supported throughout but our thanks extend to so many people that we aren&#8217;t even going to attempt a list. Hopefully you know who you are, we certainly do.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sa.jpg" alt="Sarah Angliss" width="615" height="407" /></p>
<p>Our fundraising efforts raised just over £1200. Not bad for a sound art event in a rural village hall. Read on to find out what 2014 holds.</p>
<h1>Onward</h1>
<p>In order to make this sustainable, we have set a budget of £400 for each If Wet. Therefore the funds we have raised so far will cover three events in the village hall in 2014. We are now looking for funding for additional events in this our home venue. We hope that potential funders will see the effort and outcomes of our first season and will be willing to match our own fundraising. We&#8217;ll see. We&#8217;d certainly love to do more events in our hall this year, since this is where the heart of If Wet lies.</p>
<p>Once we see how we get on with our search for funding, we will define our programme at Callow End Village Hall, but for now we just wanted to provide this update and statement of intent.</p>
<p>Also, If Wet has grown wings and will take flight in 2014, stopping to perch at a variety of venues &#8211; occasionally with a subtly different format. First up, we have been asked by <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/" target="_blank">Flatpack Festival</a> to host an If Wet as part of their festival this year. The second If Wet outing of the year will be the Southbank Centre, when we host a <a href="http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/meet-the-makers-80800" target="_blank">Meet The Makers</a> event. Then we are talking with <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/" target="_blank">Capsule</a> about a potentially very exciting event in April. More details on all of these soon but we are delighted to be keeping such fabulous company!</p>
<p>AND we secured funding through <a href="http://www.soundandmusic.org/" target="_blank">Sound and Music</a>, which will see us tour some village halls this year.</p>
<p>Wowee! Thanks again to all who have supported us.</p>
<p>ONWARD.</p>
