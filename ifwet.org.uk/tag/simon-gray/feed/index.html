				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If Wet #5 was an unusually interactive event &#8211; people even went outside! <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">We</a> merely introduced this If Wet, with no further input. As ever our guests did us proud.</p>
<p>Here is the full audio recording, in three parts: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-5-part-1" target="_blank"><strong>Part1</strong></a> / <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-5-part-2" target="_blank"><strong>Part2</strong></a> / <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-5-part-3" target="_blank"><strong>Part3</strong></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of what went on, so you can access topics of interest:</p>
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604477732/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2809/9604477732_50a6eddd9b_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 03" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We set up If Wet [&#8230;] as a bit of an antidote to the rock/blues nights there are throughout the region. We didn&#8217;t really feel there was a requirement for another one of those, so we decided to set this up.&#8221;</em></p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Nikki Pugh</h1>
<p>[03:30 &#8211; 36:45 | Part 1]<br />
Nikki Pugh introduced us to her work related to space and in particular her project <em>Score for heavy objects and built environment</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604482368/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3678/9604482368_d7555765ed_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 06" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;You know there is this whole drive to make technology smaller, more invisible, I just like the idea of going &#8216;Raggghh here it is!&#8217;, and I&#8217;ve got to carry it.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Nikki discussing her huge, heavy tubes used for this project]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Inside them [&#8230;] a micro-controller. As small computer, based on the Arduino platform. It&#8217;s three things really: it&#8217;s little PCBs with computer chips on them, it&#8217;s also software that is designed for artists to use, and a massive support community as well.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604448712/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7439/9604448712_6128da9d8e_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 08" width="640" height="494" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Inside here I&#8217;ve got two GPS receivers [&#8230;] just the raw component. [&#8230;] and a solenoid.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604447102/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7403/9604447102_625c51044b_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 09" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I view these as this kind of expanded, augmented sense, and use it to pull people&#8217;s attention to the built environment around them in different ways. [&#8230;] I walked down New Street in Birmingham and because I was carrying this kind of equipment with me, suddenly noticed OH! there are trees all down New Street. Just because it made me raise my eye-line and look up. [&#8230;] To try and make people tune in in different ways.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We&#8217;re just going to play you some of the data recorded on the walk. [&#8230;] It&#8217;s the data themselves played back in the same way that they tap as you carry them around. [&#8230;] It&#8217;s quite a direct link back to all that sweating and swearing.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Because it&#8217;s quite an abstract process I wanted to give you the opportunity to experience these yourselves.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We all head outside with the Heavy Objects.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Kathy Hinde</h1>
<p>[00:20 &#8211; 55:00 | Part 2]<br />
Kathy Hinde discusses her project <em>Vocal Migrations</em> and the influences that led her to create the project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9601215919/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7453/9601215919_f054c43bd7_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 18" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;My background is working with music and visual art. I&#8217;ve never really wanted to decide between the two, I&#8217;ve always wanted to do both.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;I got involved with an organisation called COMMA, which stands for Contemporary Music Making for Amateurs. That&#8217;s using the word amateur in its original meaning, which means for the love of it.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9601214563/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5331/9601214563_fba12f6034_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 19" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We were doing full orchestra pieces that were for wine glasses, fire extinguishers and you know, cellos and violins and pianos. [&#8230;] The way that some of the composers chose to deal with this mixed ensemble of different abilities and maybe odd instrument combinations were really interesting. There were all sorts of different strategies.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;One of the pieces was working with the composer Terry Riley. [&#8230;] COMMA did the UK premi√®re of this piece with Terry Riley. [&#8230;] Terry Riley was conducting. Not really realising the significance of how great this guy is; these were really formative experiences.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9601266579/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3805/9601266579_109c901751_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 21" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Moving on to my piece Vocal Migrations, I wanted to work with this idea of an open score.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;There is so much in nature that creates incredible complex beauty that works with very, very simple rules.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s inspired by how bats use sound to see. [&#8230;] There is a guy in America called Daniel Kish who is blind who has taught himself to echolocate using clicks.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604514146/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5521/9604514146_8607be9d42_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 27" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s this idea of creating a situation or a behaviour for people to be immersed in. I think once you remove sight then there is something quite interesting happens in terms of having to trust this device, having to really listen [&#8230;] and there is this point at which you really relax into it, and sort of go I&#8217;m OK, I can just use my listening to these sounds to make sense of my environment.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604511928/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/9604511928_f3df70f72f_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 26" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Run What Ya Brung</h1>
<p>[01:05:14 &#8211; 01:16:45 | Part 2]<br />
We run a regular feature at If Wet in which members of the audience are invited to bring along and demonstrate instruments, sound objects and sonic oddities. This month we had a viola da gamba and recorder piece, an iPhone drone app and a bass string drone instrument.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 130%;">Tim Cranmore and Ange</h1>
<p>[00:30 &#8211; 12:50 | Part 3]<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604515944/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5548/9604515944_a0c8d377e9_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 31" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We are just going to play a bit of music, if I dare mention the word.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The Viola da gamba came before all the other stringed instruments.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fippleflute.co.uk/" target="_blank">fippleflute.co.uk</a></p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 130%;">Simon Gray</h1>
<p>[14:04 &#8211; 21:45 | Part 3]<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604518980/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7420/9604518980_53bdcb3d3f_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 33" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;A lot of us who make drone-based music will have an app called iTablaPro, which as well as having tabla drums has a tanpura, which generates Indian drones. When we are playing drone-based music we don&#8217;t always want to have the Indian sound, we might want an electronic sound.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.star-one.org.uk/" target="_blank">star-one.org.uk</a></p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 130%;">Richard Windley</h1>
<p>[23:10 &#8211; 31:07 | Part 3]<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/9604471104/in/set-72157633358548063/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3724/9604471104_81e11e27b1_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 5 - August - 36" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Then I came across this reference to an early instrument called a Trumpet Marine (sic). it was a single stringed instrument and rather than fret it you played the harmonics on it. And then I remembered something a lap steel player showed me and that is if you play a harmonic on an open string and then slide the bar up the harmonic actually follows the note, [&#8230;] which surprised me.&#8221;</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday the 28th of April 2013, we managed to convince a sizeable group of people to make their way to Callow End Village Hall for the inaugural If Wet. That was pretty encouraging; we are in the sticks after all. With the <a href="place http://www.ifwet.org.uk/when/" target="_blank">line-up</a> we have in place for the next four events we hope this will build.</p>
<p>Our aim is to document each If Wet, starting from &#8220;audio only&#8221; but moving towards &#8220;video, photo and audio&#8221;. As our first event involved the inevitable extra stress associated with not really knowing what we were doing, and we were central in presenting a number of pieces of work, even the &#8220;audio only&#8221; documentation was a little tricky this time. As such we have post-produced the audio we captured for intelligibility above all other considerations. We have split this into two parts for easier listening (and to cut out the tea break) &#8211; <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-1-part-1" target="_blank"><strong>Part1</strong></a> / <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-1-part-2" target="_blank"><strong>Part2</strong></a></p>
<p>We thought it might also be useful to provide an overview of what went on, so you can access topics of interest and get a feel for future events. Here is how it went:</p>
<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;[If Wet is&#8230;] to give us a rolling monthly deadline in order to demonstrate work in progress, get feedback from an audience and generally have an ethos for ourselves and anyone else who is coming along to demonstrate their working methods, have a bit of a discussion around that; try and learn from one another.&#8221;</em></p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Placebo Gong Project</h2>
<p>[5:25 &#8211; 37:36 | Part 1]<br />
Using two C-tuned gongs on loan from CBSO / BCMG we demonstrated our work-in-progress. When this work is completed, musicians will be able to process the sound of their instruments through one or more gongs.</p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The aim for the project overall is to get enough power into them with a musical instrument that somebody can play with the [resonant] frequencies of the gong.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The best indication of how it should sound starts at around <strong><em>10:30</em></strong>. The distinction here is that we were using a signal generator as the audio source. This doesn&#8217;t allow for such an intuitive response from the player, which is likely to be crucial in the development of this project.</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;You very soon fall off the end of people&#8217;s knowledge about even how the instruments <strong>they make</strong> work.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about how much of our work is at or beyond the edge of conventional thinking / knowledge]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;There&#8217;s something very strange going on. This is going to happen a lot at If Wet. That&#8217;s partly the point.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about the technical difficulties we experienced]</span></p>
<p><em>Note: As you will hear from the audio, we experienced a few difficulties when demonstrating this project on the night. We have recordings <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/gong-snippet" target="_blank">here</a> (driven with a signal generator) and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/fretless-gong-snippet" target="_blank">here</a> (driven with a fretless guitar) that better demonstrate the potential.</em></p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Giant Feedback Organ</h2>
<p>[37:36 &#8211; 54:40 | Part 1]<br />
Using an extendible length grain blowing pipe (on loan from our local farm) we have been creating a series of low notes, using only the length of the pipe, a microphone, a speaker and an EQ.</p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Up the middle of the auditorium, if that&#8217;s what this is, you will see a huge pipe. Gill, who is stood over there is the wife of our local farmer, who very kindly lent us these pipes, which normally have grain blown up them, and what we are doing with them is trying to create a feedback organ. [&#8230;] What we are using is the pipe to determine what note is created, what frequency that feedback fires off at.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s rather like a bad clarinettist or a bad saxophone player; if you don&#8217;t blow it hard enough it will squeak. [&#8230;] it needs less energy to start it at a higher harmonic than it does on the fundamental. [&#8230;] You put it [the mic] in, it squeaks, you put the notch in where it squeaks, it&#8217;ll squeak at the next one down, you gradually drive it down so that it goes off at the fundamental.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about our use of an EQ to drive the frequency down]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We did briefly make this with two different diameters of pipe, one slid inside the other. So we made the biggest swannee whistle in the world.&#8221;</em><br />

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Isle of Everywhere</h1>
<p>[00:18 &#8211; 30:56 | Part 2]<br />
Two-thirds of The Isle of Everywhere kindly filled our main guest slot with an explanation and demonstrating of the complexities of melding traditions and tunings in their dub band, which features tuba, drums and santoor. There was a technical explanation and demonstration of both instruments and the scales they use together, followed by a performance piece to illustrate the results. Stuart also provided a demonstration of some extended tuba techniques after their performance.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Run What Ya Brung</h1>
<p>[52:20 &#8211; 1:02:18 | Part 2]<br />
We run a regular feature at If Wet in which members of the audience are invited to bring along and demonstrate instruments, sound objects and sonic oddities. We were very lucky to have such great contributions to this slot at the first If Wet.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Tim Cranmore</h1>
<p>[52:25 &#8211; 58:04 | Part 2]<br />
Tim is a local recorder maker and maker/player in the UK Vegetable Orchestra. He wowed us with a collection of three instruments including: one of his fipple-flutes, a Paetzold contrabass recorder and a recorder made from a carrot ‚Äì on which he played some Mozart!</p>

<p>The evening ended with a lot of people sticking around to chat. One of the core aims of If Wet it to build links locally. We are confident there are people who share our interests out there and we&#8217;d like to hook up with them to form some sort of creative community. If Wet #1 was a VERY positive start in that direction!</p>
