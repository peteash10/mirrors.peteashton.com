				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If Wet #20 &#8211; our last in 2014 &#8211; is just over a week away. <strong>Sunday 30th November, 2-4pm</strong>!<br />
JOIN US.</p>
<p>We are delighted to have <a href="http://rosannerobertson.com/" target="_blank">Rosanne Robertson</a> presenting her work.</p>
<p>______________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>As our final If Wet of the season &#8211; and the last before we hand things over to the Kickstarter Gods &#8211; we plan to run things a little differently from normal; and have a bit of a celebration. There will be no presentation of work from us, we&#8217;ll start with a presentation from our guest artist Rosanne Robertson. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rosanne-rooftop2.jpg" alt="Rosanne Robertson" width="614" height="345" /></p>
<p>Rosanne is an artist based in the North of England working with vibrations, objects and the body.</p>
<p>Since graduating from Fine Art at Manchester School of Art in 2009 Robertson has exhibited and performed at places such as The Bluecoat Gallery (Liverpool), Silent Barn (New York) and Roodkapje (Rotterdam). Recent projects include sound art commissions for Museum of Science and Industry and John Rylands Library at Asia Triennial Manchester 14 for sound art series Call and Response by Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art and also a mini residency and state side edition of Noise Above Noise for Exchange Rates Bushwick in Brooklyn. And now she is coming to our village hall in Callow End!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always nice to welcome artists to If Wet that also run artist-led spaces / events and <a href="http://thepenthousenq.com/" target="_blank">The Penthouse</a> in Manchester and her event NOISE ABOVE NOISE are just that. </p>
<p>For If Wet she will deliver a performative presentation created for the occasion, entitled Objectum Sexuality &#8211; usually a term used to describe people who develop emotional connections and loving relationships with inanimate objects &#8211; Robertson will borrow the term to demonstrate her methods, recent collections, sound makers, arrangements and her connections to them. The presentation will be semi improvised in-keeping with her live practice and will involve various art works, texts, visuals, pre recorded and live sound to create an overall live impression of her work. </p>
<p>This is what Dazed and Confused said about Rosanne: &#8220;For me Rosanne&#8217;s very much a &#8216;doodlebug&#8217;, that is to say, a provocateur who tirelessly works across all  platforms, creating work by any medium necessary and who works beneath the skin&#8221;</p>
<p>____________</p>
<p>Following on from Rosanne&#8217;s presentation we will have a bit of a review and celebration of our second season. This will be relatively low-key; a chance to relax with you all before we head to <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186424-d3387271-Reviews-Blue_Bell-Worcester_Worcestershire_England.html" title="Blue Bell" target="_blank">the local pub</a> afterwards to continue celebrations. We won&#8217;t get to the pub until after they stop serving food but they offer a 10% discount to anyone attending If Wet if you want to eat beforehand&#8230;BUT &#8211; as ever &#8211; there will be plenty of lovely food at If Wet itself; so we can get properly fed before we get watered.</p>
<p>Lastly, as usual we&#8217;d welcome short, informal presentations in our Run What Ya Brung section. Just bring any sonic oddity along and you can present it to the audience for their wonderment. We hope we might coax a couple of regular contributors to bring something along, to present at our final event before we roll the Kickstarter dice.</p>
<p>Oh and this is all accompanied by the usual local ale, home-made grub and cake. JOIN US.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our final If Wet of the season is fast approaching; <strong>SATURDAY 30th November, 5.30pm &#8211; 11pm</strong>. <em>Note: <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/fundraiser-start-delayed-until-530pm/" target="_blank">slight delay</a> in starting due to a bouncy castle.</em></p>
<p>For our final event we have a much extended offering, on a Saturday, so people can join us in celebrating our first season. By coming to this special fundraising event you will be helping to make our second season happen.</p>
<p>There will be presentations and discussion, much like a normal If Wet, but this event will feature musical performances more centrally.</p>
<p>JOIN US for a night of sonic exploration and wonderment >> <a href="https://ifwet-fundraiser.eventbrite.co.uk" target="_blank">Tickets here</a> </p>
<p><strong>Line-up:</strong><br />
Sarah Angliss / Isle of Everywhere / ORE / Nimzo-Indian / Soundhog (DJ) / MortonUnderwood</p>
<h1>MortonUnderwood</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/david.jpg" alt="Morton" width="615" height="308" /></p>

<div class="imageTitle">Underwood</div>
<p>Your every faithful hosts, <a href="http://mortonunderwood.co.uk" title="MortonUnderwood" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will welcome you to the final If Wet of the season with a smile &#8211; all being well. The evening will start with some time for guests (new and old) to mingle and settle into the space and pace of the village hall &#8211; and explore the various goodies in the fundraising auction etc. We will then present a celebratory review of the previous events before moving on to showcase stuff that will feature in the fundraising auction. Then, the latest presentation of work by MortonUnderwood.</p>
<h1>Nimzo-Indian</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mini-guitar.jpg" alt="Nimzo-Indian" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Nimzo-Indian</div>
<p>Next up there will be a presentation and live performance by Nimzo-Indian, an alter-ego of artist and technologist <a href="http://fatsuma.co.uk/pages/frame2.html" target="_blank">Fatsuma</a>. Andy will discuss his work and present four mini guitars he has built, before going on to deliver an unpredictable performance with them.</p>
<p><em>At this point we&#8217;ll break for some refreshments. Hot food and drinks will be provided, as will cakes, snacks, wine, local ale and soft drinks.</em></p>
<h1>ORE</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ore.jpg" alt="ORE" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">ORE</div>
<p>With your belly full of grub, ease into a satiated transcendental state with a live set from drone doom tuba duo <a href="http://www.oretubadoom.com" target="_blank">ORE</a>. Again there will be a brief discussion about their ethos and working method ahead of the performance.</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F107308486&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938"></iframe></p>
<h1>Isle of Everywhere</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ioe.jpg" alt="Isle of Everywhere" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Isle of Everywhere</div>
<p>After ORE we are delighted to welcome back a band that were at our inaugural If Wet in April, the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/IsleOfE" target="_blank">Isle of Everywhere</a> (duo). They feature Stuart on tuba (if he has any puff left after playing with ORE) and Simon on santur. A rare combination; together in dub. <em>Note: this is a duo performance without Lydia on drums.</em></p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/66818452" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" title="Hammered Tubstep" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h1>Sarah Angliss</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sarah1.jpg" alt="Sarah Angliss" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Sarah Angliss</div>
<p>Our last live act of the evening is <a href="http://www.sarahangliss.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Angliss</a>. Her last appearance at If Wet was a delight to behold and we are very pleased to welcome her back; only this time the emphasis will be much more on performance rather than discussion of working methods &#8211; although there will be a element of that too!</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F104099953&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938&#038;in=spacedoguk%2Fsets%2Fsarah-angliss-music-samples-1"></iframe></p>
<h1>Soundhog</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soundhog.jpg" alt="Soundhog" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Soundhog</div>
<p>The rest of the evening will be spent celebrating and discussing, to a soundtrack provided by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundhog" target="_blank">Soundhog</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F39920118&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938"></iframe></p>
<p>We are not really sure what more we can do to entice you to our village hall; it should be a really distinctive experience. Step out of your world and into ours for a night. </p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall on Saturday the 30th November at 5pm! Tickets on the door, £14. Or we have a few other ticket options available <a href="https://ifwet-fundraiser.eventbrite.co.uk" target="_blank">on-line</a> </p>
