				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our final If Wet of the season is fast approaching; <strong>SATURDAY 30th November, 5.30pm &#8211; 11pm</strong>. <em>Note: <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/fundraiser-start-delayed-until-530pm/" target="_blank">slight delay</a> in starting due to a bouncy castle.</em></p>
<p>For our final event we have a much extended offering, on a Saturday, so people can join us in celebrating our first season. By coming to this special fundraising event you will be helping to make our second season happen.</p>
<p>There will be presentations and discussion, much like a normal If Wet, but this event will feature musical performances more centrally.</p>
<p>JOIN US for a night of sonic exploration and wonderment >> <a href="https://ifwet-fundraiser.eventbrite.co.uk" target="_blank">Tickets here</a> </p>
<p><strong>Line-up:</strong><br />
Sarah Angliss / Isle of Everywhere / ORE / Nimzo-Indian / Soundhog (DJ) / MortonUnderwood</p>
<h1>MortonUnderwood</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/david.jpg" alt="Morton" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Morton</div>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sam.jpg" alt="Morton" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Underwood</div>
<p>Your every faithful hosts, <a href="http://mortonunderwood.co.uk" title="MortonUnderwood" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will welcome you to the final If Wet of the season with a smile &#8211; all being well. The evening will start with some time for guests (new and old) to mingle and settle into the space and pace of the village hall &#8211; and explore the various goodies in the fundraising auction etc. We will then present a celebratory review of the previous events before moving on to showcase stuff that will feature in the fundraising auction. Then, the latest presentation of work by MortonUnderwood.</p>
<h1>Nimzo-Indian</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mini-guitar.jpg" alt="Nimzo-Indian" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Nimzo-Indian</div>
<p>Next up there will be a presentation and live performance by Nimzo-Indian, an alter-ego of artist and technologist <a href="http://fatsuma.co.uk/pages/frame2.html" target="_blank">Fatsuma</a>. Andy will discuss his work and present four mini guitars he has built, before going on to deliver an unpredictable performance with them.</p>
<p><em>At this point we&#8217;ll break for some refreshments. Hot food and drinks will be provided, as will cakes, snacks, wine, local ale and soft drinks.</em></p>
<h1>ORE</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ore.jpg" alt="ORE" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">ORE</div>
<p>With your belly full of grub, ease into a satiated transcendental state with a live set from drone doom tuba duo <a href="http://www.oretubadoom.com" target="_blank">ORE</a>. Again there will be a brief discussion about their ethos and working method ahead of the performance.</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F107308486&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938"></iframe></p>
<h1>Isle of Everywhere</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ioe.jpg" alt="Isle of Everywhere" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Isle of Everywhere</div>
<p>After ORE we are delighted to welcome back a band that were at our inaugural If Wet in April, the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/IsleOfE" target="_blank">Isle of Everywhere</a> (duo). They feature Stuart on tuba (if he has any puff left after playing with ORE) and Simon on santur. A rare combination; together in dub. <em>Note: this is a duo performance without Lydia on drums.</em></p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/66818452" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" title="Hammered Tubstep" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h1>Sarah Angliss</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sarah1.jpg" alt="Sarah Angliss" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Sarah Angliss</div>
<p>Our last live act of the evening is <a href="http://www.sarahangliss.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Angliss</a>. Her last appearance at If Wet was a delight to behold and we are very pleased to welcome her back; only this time the emphasis will be much more on performance rather than discussion of working methods &#8211; although there will be a element of that too!</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F104099953&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938&#038;in=spacedoguk%2Fsets%2Fsarah-angliss-music-samples-1"></iframe></p>
<h1>Soundhog</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soundhog.jpg" alt="Soundhog" width="615" height="308" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Soundhog</div>
<p>The rest of the evening will be spent celebrating and discussing, to a soundtrack provided by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundhog" target="_blank">Soundhog</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F39920118&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938"></iframe></p>
<p>We are not really sure what more we can do to entice you to our village hall; it should be a really distinctive experience. Step out of your world and into ours for a night. </p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall on Saturday the 30th November at 5pm! Tickets on the door, Â£14. Or we have a few other ticket options available <a href="https://ifwet-fundraiser.eventbrite.co.uk" target="_blank">on-line</a> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long until If Wet #7; <strong>Sunday 27th October, 2-4pm</strong>. For our penultimate event of our first season we have a double-bill made up of the fabulous <a href="http://www.helenwhitedesign.com/" target="_blank">Helen White</a> and <a href="http://www.soundsurvey.org.uk/" target="_blank">Ian Rawes</a>. JOIN US.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/hw-s.jpg" alt="Helen White" width="694" height="392" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Solar-wind Chime, Helen White</div>
<p>Inspired by recent media attention on solar flares and their effects on both positive and predicted negative events (the northern lights / technological disruption), Helen has been exploring creative ways to respond to this natural phenomena. She will be presenting her &#8216;solar-wind&#8217; chime, a slowly-evolving resonating sculpture that responds in real-time to solar wind data collected from a satellite an hour away from earth, and she&#8217;ll be talking about working with complicated scientific principles and aesthetically bereft data sources that finally led her to listen to the sun.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/65346809" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>By day Ian Rawes works in the sound archive at the British Library. He also runs <a href="http://www.soundsurvey.org.uk/" target="_blank">London Sound Survey</a>, a growing collection of Creative Commons-licensed sound recordings of places, events and wildlife in the capital.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lss.gif" alt="London Sound Survey" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">London Sound Survey, Ian Rawes</div>
<p>Ian will present a series of rarely-heard and never-heard archival recordings of vanished customs and daily life from London in the 1920s to the 1950s. Performing dogs, fortune tellers, Mike Stern the mayor of Petticoat Lane, lavender sellers, the singing sewer workers of the New Kent Road, Commander Daniel&#8217;s noise nuisances, Godfrey the bagpipe king and how London Zoo&#8217;s animals helped win the war.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mu.jpg" alt="Sound Trolley" width="615" height="443" /></p>
<p>Your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will be presenting the Sound Trolley they built for their recent artist residency at the Library of Birmingham.</p>
<p>We will also have our regular Run What Ya Brung section where anyone can do a brief, informal presentation of a sonic curiosity they might own or have built. Last month we had Richard Windley with and acoustic guitar (!) and harp combo he had made. Please JOIN US and contribute!</p>
<p>We will also have the usual yummy treats of home-made food, cakes and a local ale.</p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall on Sunday the 27th October at 2pm! Tickets on the door.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long now until our sixth If Wet; <strong>Sunday 29th September, 2-4pm</strong>. We have a double-bill for you made up of the fabulous <a href="http://grahamdunning.com/" target="_blank">Graham Dunning</a> and <a href="http://soundhog.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Soundhog</a>. JOIN US.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dunning.jpg" alt="Music by the metre" width="615" height="345" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Music by the Metre, Graham Dunning</div>
<p>Graham will be presenting his <em>Music by the Metre</em> project, including a live build of a <em>Music by the Metre</em> piece. The project is an homage to situationist Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio who made and sold abstract &#8220;painting by the metre&#8221;.</p>
<p>Each one is a system of sound making machines which will play indefinitely if left to run. The resulting audio is never changing but never the same: loops of different tempos mix with unstable drones and live environmental sound (a mic out of the window) to make a stable but evolving collage. For If Wet Graham will build one of these conglomerate machines and talk through this process.</p>
<p>Graham is also making a run of 10 recycled tapes individually recorded with a different <em>Music by the Metre</em> piece on each side and a handmade cover.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/soundhog.jpg" alt="Soundhog" width="615" height="345" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Soundhog</div>
<p>Soundhog (Ben) is a bit of an unknown quantity in the context of If Wet. In fact, we don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;ll be covering yet. It&#8217;s quite likely Ben doesn&#8217;t know yet either. BUT we do know that he has a wealth of knowledge, a rich history of making Bastard Pop hits, a fascination for antiquated recordings and technologies, and a near encyclopaedic knowledge of pop music. Soundhog doesn&#8217;t come out to play often so miss this at your peril.</p>
<p>Oh, and he only has a Wikipedia page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundhog" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundhog</a></p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F39920118&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=625&#038;maxheight=938"></iframe></p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ear.jpg" alt="A Word In Your Ear" width="615" height="345" /></p>
<p>All being well, your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will be presenting a few projects they have been working on lately, as part of Sam&#8217;s artist residency at <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/" target="_blank">THSH Birmingham</a>.</p>
<p>We will also have our regular Run What Ya Brung section where anyone can do a brief, informal presentation of a sonic curiosity they might own or have built. Last month we had a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-5-snippet" target="_blank">delightful performance</a> of viola da gamba and recorder music, a phone based drone synthesis tool and a self-made, bass drone string instrument. Please JOIN US and contribute!</p>
<p>We will also have the usual yummy treats of home-made food, cakes and a local ale.</p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall on Sunday the 29th September at 2pm!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s just one week until If Wet #5 &#8211; <strong>Sunday 25th August, 2-4pm</strong>. We have a double-bill for you made up of the fabulous <a href="http://kathyhinde.co.uk/" target="_blank">Kathy Hinde</a> and <a href="http://npugh.co.uk/" target="_blank">Nikki Pugh</a>. JOIN US.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/vm-preview.jpg" alt="Vocal Migrations" width="615" height="407"  /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Vocal Migrations, Kathy Hinde</div>
<p>Kathy will be presenting her <em>Vocal Migrations</em> work, which combines live singing with electronically altered voices and is inspired by how bats &#8216;Echo-locate&#8217; by using sound to &#8216;see&#8217; their surroundings. The results and implications for music and performance are fascinating. Oh and Kathy has also been using the technology to help people navigate spaces without using their vision.</p>
<p>Come and experience this first hand!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/np-preview.jpg" alt="Score for heavy objects and built environment" width="615" height="461" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Score for heavy objects and built environment, Nikki Pugh</div>
<p>Nikki will be presenting her work <em>Score for heavy objects and built environment</em>. As I have experienced before from Nikki this project required some lugging around of odd GPS-enabled objects in preparation (see image above).</p>
<p>Come and hear the results! </p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/route.gif" alt="Route" width="615" height="505" /></p>
<div class="imageTitle">Score for heavy objects and built environment, route</div>
<p>Your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> are taking a bit of a back seat for this one, but you can never be quite sure what we might bring along!</p>
<p>We will also have our regular Run What Ya Brung section where anyone can do a brief, informal presentation of a sonic curiosity they might own or have built. Last month we had a (rare-as-rocking-horse-dung) Stroh guitar demonstrated by Richard Windley. Please JOIN US and contribute!</p>

<p>If Wet #4 will soon be upon us &#8211; Sunday 21st July, <strong>2-4pm</strong>.<br />
<em>Note: this is a week earlier than normal, as Sam is performing at <a href="http://fonfestival.org/Home.html" target="_blank">FON</a> the following weekend.</em></p>
<p>We welcome the wonderful Laura Kriefman of <a href="http://www.guerilladanceproject.com/" target="_blank">Guerilla Dance Project</a> from Bristol to talk about how a dancer and choreographer started playing with sound. She will present her <em>Rolling Stones</em> project and some work she has been doing on building mechanical birds.</p>

<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 510px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Mechanical bird</div>
<p>Here&#8217;s the promo video from when Laura&#8217;s <em>Rolling Stones </em> appeared at The Southbank Centre. Next stop, Callow End Village Hall.<br />

<p>Your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will be presenting their new release on RHP, entitled <a href="http://rhpcdrs.wordpress.com/2013/07/01/out-now-mortonunderwoods-field-augmentation-cdr/" target="_blank">Field Augmentation</a>. An overview of how the pieces are created will be provided, along with some demonstration pieces.</p>

<p>We will also have our regular Run What Ya Brung section where anyone can do a brief, informal presentation of a sonic curiosity they might own or have built. Last month we had a range of exciting stuff, including: techno clog dancing, a multi-faceted noise box synth and a selection of three-hole whistles / flutes. Please JOIN US and contribute!</p>
<p>We will also have the usual yummy treats of home-made food, cakes and a local ale.</p>
<p>We are most excited and hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall on Sunday the 21st July at 2pm!</p>

<p>The next If Wet is fast approaching &#8211; Sunday 30th June, <strong>at the new time of 2-4pm</strong>. We are delighted to have the wonderful <a href="http://www.sarahangliss.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Angliss</a> up from Brighton to talk about her automata and how she uses them in her live performances. She has also hinted at a couple of other pieces she would like to demonstrate in public for the first time, which is most exciting!</p>

<p>Your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> will be taking a bit of a back seat for this If Wet. We hope to bring a little something along but we wanted to give the bulk of the event over to our guests. As well as Sarah we also have Paul John back, this time with a clavichord to play for you. He will talk a bit about the history and features of the instrument too.</p>

<p>As usual the evening will start with your hosts <a href="http://www.mortonunderwood.co.uk" target="_blank">MortonUnderwood</a> presenting an area of their work. This time it&#8217;s all about their synths. They will be showcasing a series of noise box synths and associated kit, and hope to provide a demo of them used in a musical context. They will also unveil their most comprehensively specified synth to date, codenamed<br />
THE BEAST.</p>

<p>Oh, and it&#8217;s a bank holiday Sunday and a damn nice part of the country. So, why not consider <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/make-a-day-of-it/" target="_blank">making a day</a> of your trip? </p>
<p>We hope to see you at Callow End Village Hall, this Sunday, 5pm.</p>
