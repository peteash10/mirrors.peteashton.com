				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As outlined in <a href="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/news/if-wet-the-future/" target="_blank">our future plans</a>, we are starting a regular monthly radio programme, to fall &#8211; as If Wet does &#8211; on the last Sunday of the month, from 2-4pm; during our off-season.</p>
<p>At present we are thinking we will &#8220;broadcast&#8221; via Mixcloud (embedded on our site) and we are also finalising plans with <a href="http://www.soundartradio.org.uk/" title="Soundart Radio" target="_blank">Soundart Radio</a> to include our show in their schedule.</p>
<p>For now, the shows will be pre-recorded but we plan to always make them live in a given timeslot and then be on-hand via <a href="https://twitter.com/If_Wet" target="_blank">Twitter </a> for any interaction and feedback. Our first show will provide some holiday listening for most, as it will be aired at 2pm on December the 28th.</p>
<p>Each show will focus on a different musical instrument and is intended to drive our research and development as instrument makers, as well as hopefully being entertaining! It&#8217;s not intended to be comprehensive; more a snapshot of what we have unearthed to date.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 120%;">Please help!</strong><br />
We need your help, on two fronts:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have never run a radio show before so please let us know anything you know about that. Anything goes at this stage; from suggestions that our approach is all wrong, through to personal reflections about what you like as a listener</li>
<li>Links and suggestions for our first show, which will focus on the <strong>tuba</strong>. Please just add information on anything or anyone you think is exciting in the world of the tuba, via the comments. We are open to all sorts: from contacting players for input, to talking about technical aspects, to playing banging brass band party tunes. We&#8217;d rather you popped it in the comments and we didn&#8217;t end up featuring it than missing something great that&#8217;s out there&#8230;</li>
</ol>
<p>SO, please help us by popping your comments below. We look forward to reading them!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 80%;">[Oh and we have some ideas for what instruments to feature next but we welcome yours]</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If Wet #2 was a slightly more intimate affair than If Wet #1. The first hot day for ages and a bank holiday Sunday surely didn&#8217;t help in terms of numbers but we had a fun and informative time hosting the wonderful Juneau Projects.</p>
<p>Here is the full audio recording, in two parts: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-2-part-1" target="_blank"><strong>Part1</strong></a> / <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-2-part-2" target="_blank"><strong>Part2</strong></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of what went on, so you can access topics of interest:</p>
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/8905089099/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7415/8905089099_2c25a85430_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 2 - May - 10" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 520px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;If at any point in proceedings you want to interject, ask a question, just stick your hand up. We have a very open forum throughout all of this!&#8221;</em></p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">MortonUnderwood present&#8230;</h1>
<p>[2:52 &#8211; 51:20 | Part 1]</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Noise box synths and optical sequencer</h2>
<p>[2:52 &#8211; 34:08 | Part 1]<br />
We brought along three of our Game Conroller noise box synths, a stereo noise box (codenamed THE BEAST), a controller in a Spam tin and our prototype optical sequencer to demo.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/8905065399/in/set-72157633358548063"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8560/8905065399_d00b91d1e6_z.jpg" alt="If Wet 2 - May - 02" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 520px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Arguably the standard format for these sorts of noise boxes is for them to be a drone noise box. [demo] [&#8230;] What we wanted to do with these, this particular model, is make something that&#8217;s a bit more <em>playable</em>, so you can be quite rhythmical. [demo]&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about our Game Controller format synths]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s simulating what it is like if the battery goes flat. [&#8230;] controlling the amount of flatness your battery has, rather than having to have a selection of batteries that you pop in.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about power-starve on our synths]</span></p>
<p>All the synths we build have at least one oscillator wired out to two photo ports, to allow the functionality to be extended via anything that provides a resistance value.</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We&#8217;re all going to try and hold hands. [&#8230;] We&#8217;ll see how successful this is.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about the synth extension and touch contacts]</span></p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;the extension allows you to design something that does for you what you want to do in your liveset&#8221;</em><br />

<p>Next up David demonstrated the optical sequencer he has built, which again can wire into the extension port of our synths.</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;we call this, as a sort of working title, the Pocket Oramics&#8221;</em><br />

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Part of the thinking with these is that they can be made cheaply enough so that they can be bought by anyone that wishes to experiment. &#8220;</em><br />

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The suggestion was that you could have one mechanical device that is pulling this strip through and another mechanical device that had a pen on it, which was then writing on it.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about an idea for a generative sequencer suggested at If Wet #1]</span></p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">3D printed tuba mouthpiece</h2>
<p>[34:08 &#8211; 51:04 | Part 1]<br />
During If Wet #2 we were running a &#8220;MarkerBot Replicator 2&#8221; 3D printer at the back of the hall. It printed a tuba mouthpiece. We had a pre-prepared (filed and sanded) version of this mouthpiece with us, which we demonstrated attached to Sam&#8217;s tuba.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ifwet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tuba.jpg" alt="3D printed tuba mouthpiece" width="625" height="425" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -26px; margin-left: 520px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Photo: Pete Ashton</div>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Quick Google, mouthpiece.stl, oh look somebody has put up a CAD design for a trombone mouthpiece. Trouble is I don&#8217;t know any trombone players. [&#8230;] Quick Google, find out how long a tuba mouthpiece is, take the trombone mouthpiece dimensions and just make one that&#8217;s the same length, and let all the other dimensions go.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The interesting point is you can now choose to do things you couldn&#8217;t normally do with a conventional mouthpiece. [&#8230;] I could take a pressure driver, a loudspeaker in a can, a pipe, build one of these with a pipe attachment and I can now have a sequence of notes playing through here while Sam plays another sequence on the tuba. [&#8230;] I have no idea whether that will sound interesting, horrible, exciting, good, bad, or indifferent, but I bet nobody has done that before.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about the melting point of 3D printed PLA material]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;So a PLA teapot isn&#8217;t quite a chocolate teapot but it&#8217;s well on the way to being a chocolate teapot.&#8221;</em><br />

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Juneau Projects</h1>
<p>[00:35 &#8211; 41:00 | Part 2]<br />
It was a delight having Juneau Projects come down to talk about their project &#8220;Blackbird in Infospace&#8221;, their EP which is downloadable to a USB drive at &#8220;shrines&#8221; throughout Worcester. They also demonstrated their distinctive musical instruments and performed a piece from the EP.</p>

<p>[41:32 &#8211; 57:00 | Part 2]<br />
We run a regular feature at If Wet in which members of the audience are invited to bring along and demonstrate instruments, sound objects and sonic oddities. Thanks to Richard for bringing another great piece to If Wet.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Richard Windley</h1>
<p>[58:48 &#8211; 1:02:18 | Part 2]<br />
Richard is a Hereford-based artist/maker who is currently working in the field of technical reproductions, created for television and film. His work and experience spans many years. He brought along two of his Theremins to show us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.richardwindley.co.uk/" target="_blank">richardwindley.co.uk</a></p>
<p>Once again, the evening ended with a lot of people sticking around to chat. One of the core aims of If Wet it to build links locally. We are confident there are people who share our interests out there and we&#8217;d like to hook up with them to form some sort of creative community. Another successful If Wet, see you at the next one!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday the 28th of April 2013, we managed to convince a sizeable group of people to make their way to Callow End Village Hall for the inaugural If Wet. That was pretty encouraging; we are in the sticks after all. With the <a href="place http://www.ifwet.org.uk/when/" target="_blank">line-up</a> we have in place for the next four events we hope this will build.</p>
<p>Our aim is to document each If Wet, starting from &#8220;audio only&#8221; but moving towards &#8220;video, photo and audio&#8221;. As our first event involved the inevitable extra stress associated with not really knowing what we were doing, and we were central in presenting a number of pieces of work, even the &#8220;audio only&#8221; documentation was a little tricky this time. As such we have post-produced the audio we captured for intelligibility above all other considerations. We have split this into two parts for easier listening (and to cut out the tea break) &#8211; <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-1-part-1" target="_blank"><strong>Part1</strong></a> / <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/if-wet-number-1-part-2" target="_blank"><strong>Part2</strong></a></p>
<p>We thought it might also be useful to provide an overview of what went on, so you can access topics of interest and get a feel for future events. Here is how it went:</p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;[If Wet is&#8230;] to give us a rolling monthly deadline in order to demonstrate work in progress, get feedback from an audience and generally have an ethos for ourselves and anyone else who is coming along to demonstrate their working methods, have a bit of a discussion around that; try and learn from one another.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>[5:25 &#8211; 54:40 | Part 1]</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Placebo Gong Project</h2>
<p>[5:25 &#8211; 37:36 | Part 1]<br />
Using two C-tuned gongs on loan from CBSO / BCMG we demonstrated our work-in-progress. When this work is completed, musicians will be able to process the sound of their instruments through one or more gongs.</p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;The aim for the project overall is to get enough power into them with a musical instrument that somebody can play with the [resonant] frequencies of the gong.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The best indication of how it should sound starts at around <strong><em>10:30</em></strong>. The distinction here is that we were using a signal generator as the audio source. This doesn&#8217;t allow for such an intuitive response from the player, which is likely to be crucial in the development of this project.</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;You very soon fall off the end of people&#8217;s knowledge about even how the instruments <strong>they make</strong> work.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about how much of our work is at or beyond the edge of conventional thinking / knowledge]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;There&#8217;s something very strange going on. This is going to happen a lot at If Wet. That&#8217;s partly the point.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about the technical difficulties we experienced]</span></p>
<p><em>Note: As you will hear from the audio, we experienced a few difficulties when demonstrating this project on the night. We have recordings <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/gong-snippet" target="_blank">here</a> (driven with a signal generator) and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mortonunderwood/fretless-gong-snippet" target="_blank">here</a> (driven with a fretless guitar) that better demonstrate the potential.</em></p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Giant Feedback Organ</h2>
<p>[37:36 &#8211; 54:40 | Part 1]<br />
Using an extendible length grain blowing pipe (on loan from our local farm) we have been creating a series of low notes, using only the length of the pipe, a microphone, a speaker and an EQ.</p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;Up the middle of the auditorium, if that&#8217;s what this is, you will see a huge pipe. Gill, who is stood over there is the wife of our local farmer, who very kindly lent us these pipes, which normally have grain blown up them, and what we are doing with them is trying to create a feedback organ. [&#8230;] What we are using is the pipe to determine what note is created, what frequency that feedback fires off at.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s rather like a bad clarinettist or a bad saxophone player; if you don&#8217;t blow it hard enough it will squeak. [&#8230;] it needs less energy to start it at a higher harmonic than it does on the fundamental. [&#8230;] You put it [the mic] in, it squeaks, you put the notch in where it squeaks, it&#8217;ll squeak at the next one down, you gradually drive it down so that it goes off at the fundamental.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about our use of an EQ to drive the frequency down]</span></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;We did briefly make this with two different diameters of pipe, one slid inside the other. So we made the biggest swannee whistle in the world.&#8221;</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">[Talking about our prior testing]</span></p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Isle of Everywhere</h1>
<p>[00:18 &#8211; 30:56 | Part 2]<br />
Two-thirds of The Isle of Everywhere kindly filled our main guest slot with an explanation and demonstrating of the complexities of melding traditions and tunings in their dub band, which features tuba, drums and santoor. There was a technical explanation and demonstration of both instruments and the scales they use together, followed by a performance piece to illustrate the results. Stuart also provided a demonstration of some extended tuba techniques after their performance.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Paul John</h1>
<p>[33:15 &#8211; 51:56 | Part 2]<br />
Paul will provide regular input at If Wet. He has a history in teaching musical instrument technology. At this If Wet he provided an insight into the development of early stringed keyboard instruments, with particular emphasis on the clavichord.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Run What Ya Brung</h1>
<p>[52:20 &#8211; 1:02:18 | Part 2]<br />
We run a regular feature at If Wet in which members of the audience are invited to bring along and demonstrate instruments, sound objects and sonic oddities. We were very lucky to have such great contributions to this slot at the first If Wet.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Tim Cranmore</h1>
<p>[52:25 &#8211; 58:04 | Part 2]<br />
Tim is a local recorder maker and maker/player in the UK Vegetable Orchestra. He wowed us with a collection of three instruments including: one of his fipple-flutes, a Paetzold contrabass recorder and a recorder made from a carrot – on which he played some Mozart!</p>

<p><em style="font-size: 150%;">&#8220;What I was hoping to do was take some of the energy out of it and turn the sinewave of the tuning fork into something that was a bit more raucous.&#8221;</em><br />

<p>The evening ended with a lot of people sticking around to chat. One of the core aims of If Wet it to build links locally. We are confident there are people who share our interests out there and we&#8217;d like to hook up with them to form some sort of creative community. If Wet #1 was a VERY positive start in that direction!</p>
